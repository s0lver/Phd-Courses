abstract = {The tracking of frequently visited places, also known as stay points, is a critical feature in location-aware mobile applications as a way to adapt the information and services provided to smartphones users according to their moving patterns. Location based applications usually employ the GPS receiver along with Wi-Fi hot-spots and cellular cell tower mechanisms for estimating user location. Typically, fine-grained GPS location data are collected by the smartphone and transferred to dedicated servers for trajectory analysis and stay points detection. Such Mobile Cloud Computing approach has been successfully employed for extending smartphone's battery lifetime by exchanging computation costs, assuming that on-device stay points detection is prohibitive. In this article, we propose and validate the feasibility of having an alternative event-driven mechanism for stay points detection that is executed fully on-device, and that provides higher energy savings by avoiding communication costs. Our solution is encapsulated in a sensing middleware for Android smartphones, where a stream of GPS location updates is collected in the background, supporting duty cycling schemes, and incrementally analyzed following an event-driven paradigm for stay points detection. To evaluate the performance of the proposed middleware, real world experiments were conducted under different stress levels, validating its power efficiency when compared against a Mobile Cloud Computing oriented solution.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of applying gait and activity recognition on a commercially available mobile smartphone, where both data collection and real-time analysis was done on the phone. The collected data was also transferred to a computer for further analysis and comparison of various distance metrics and machine learning techniques. In our experiment 5 users created each 3 templates on the phone, where the templates were related to different walking speeds. The system was tested for correct identification of the user or the walking activity with 20 new users and with the 5 enrolled users. The activities are recognised correctly with an accuracy of over 99{\%}. For gait recognition the phone learned the individual features of the 5 enrolled participants at the various walk speeds, enabling the phone to afterwards identify the current user. The new Cross Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Metric gives the best performance for gait recognition where users are identified correctly in 89.3{\%} of the cases and the false positive probability is as low as 1.4{\%}.},

abstract = {Location is a fundamental service for mobile computing. Typical GPS receivers, although widely available, consume too much energy to be useful for many applications. Observing that in many sensing scenarios, the location information can be post-processed when the data is uploaded to a server, we design a Cloud-Ofﬂoaded GPS (CO-GPS) solution that allows a sensing device to aggressively duty-cycle its GPS receiver and log just enough raw GPS signal for postprocessing. Leveraging publicly available information such as GNSS satellite ephemeris and an Earth elevation database, a cloud service can derive good quality GPS locations from a few milliseconds of raw data. Using our design of a portable sensing device platform called CLEO, we evaluate the accuracy and efﬁciency of the solution. Compared to more than 30 seconds of heavy signal processing on standalone GPS receivers, we can achieve three orders of magnitude lower energy consumption per location tagging.},

abstract = {A growing number of mobile phone applications utilize physical location to express the context of information. Most of these location-based applications assume GPS capabilities. Unfortunately, GPS incurs an unacceptable energy cost that can reduce the phone's battery life to less than nine hours. Alternate localization technologies, based on WiFi or GSM, improve battery life at the expense of localization accuracy. This paper quantifies this important tradeoff that underlies a range of emerging services. Driven by measurements from Nokia N95 phones, we develop an energy-efficient localization framework called EnLoc. The framework characterizes the optimal localization accuracy for a given energy budget, and develops prediction- based heuristics for real-time use. Evaluation on traces from real users demonstrates the possibility of achieving good localization accuracy for a realistic energy budget.},

abstract = {The complexity of indoor radio propagation has resulted in location-awareness being derived from empirical fingerprinting techniques, where positioning is performed via a previously-constructed radio map, usually of WiFi signals. The recent introduction of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio protocol provides new opportunities for indoor location. It supports portable, battery-powered beacons that can be easily distributed at low cost, giving it distinct advantages over WiFi. However, its differing use of the radio band brings new challenges too. In this work we provide a detailed study of BLE fingerprinting using 19 beacons distributed around a 600 m2 testbed to position a consumer device. We demonstrate the high susceptibility of BLE to fast fading; show how to mitigate this; quantify the true power cost of continuous BLE scanning. We further investigate the choice of key parameters in a BLE positioning system, including beacon density, transmit power, and transmit frequency. We also provide quantitative comparison with WiFi fingerprinting. Our results show advantages to the use of BLE beacons for positioning. For one-shot (push-to-fix) positioning we achieve {\textless}2.6 m error 95{\%} of the time for a dense BLE network (1 beacon per 30 m2), compared to {\textless}4.8 m for a reduced density (1 beacon per 100 m2) and {\textless}8.5 m for an established WiFi network in the same area.},

abstract = {Emerging mobile applications that sense context are poised to delight and entertain us with timely news and events, health tracking, and social connections. Unfortunately, sensing algorithms quickly drain the phone's battery. Developers can overcome battery drain by carefully optimizing context sensing but that makes programming with context arduous and ties applications to current sensing hardware. These types of applications embody a twist on the classic tension between programmer productivity and performance due to their combination of requirements. This paper identifies the latency, accuracy, battery (LAB) abstraction to resolve this tension. We implement and evaluate LAB in a system called Senergy. Developers specify their LAB requirements independent of inference algorithms and sensors. Senergy delivers energy efficient context while meeting the requirements and adapts as hardware changes. We demonstrate LAB's expressiveness by using it to implement 22 context sensing algorithms for four types of context (location, driving, walking, and stationary) and six diverse applications. To demonstrate LAB's energy optimizations, we show often an order of magnitude improvements in energy efficiency on applications compared to prior approaches. This relatively simple, priority based API, may serve as a blueprint for future API design in an increasingly complex design space that must tradeoff latency, accuracy, and efficiency to meet application needs and attain portability across evolving, sensor-rich, heterogeneous, and power constrained hardware.},

abstract = {In addition to the emergence of smartphones and tablets in recent years, the rise of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) has allowed mobile tracking applications to become popular and be put into many uses. Analyzing tracking records to identify points of interest (POIs) is useful for both prediction applications and research such as human behavior analysis, transportation planning, and especially travel surveys. Past research in travel surveys has shown that a GPS mobile phone-based survey is a useful tool for collecting information about individuals. Moreover, a passive travel survey collection is preferred to an active travel survey method by the respondents and the analysts because it is proven to be less error prone. However, passive collection remains a challenge due to a lack of high accuracy algorithms to automatically identify trip starts and trip ends. While travel surveys need a POI identification algorithm to carry out passive information collection, mobile tracking applications must be careful not to affect the user's battery life, which limits the number of GPS coordinates that can be recorded and therefore affects the accuracies of existing POI identification algorithms. This thesis presents Automatic Spatial Temporal Identification of Points of Interest (ASTIPI), an unsupervised spatial temporal algorithm to identify POIs. ASTIPI utilizes the temporal and spatial properties of the dataset to obtain a high accuracy of POI identification, even on a reduced GPS dataset that uses techniques to conserve battery life on mobile devices. While reducing outliers within POIs, ASTIPI also has a linear running time and maintains the temporal orders of the location data so that arrival and departure information can be easily extracted and thus, users' trips can be quickly identified. Using data from real mobile devices, evaluations of ASTIPI and other existing algorithms are performed, showing that ASTIPI obtains the highest accuracy of POI identification with an average accuracy of 88{\%} when performing on full datasets generated using the GPS Auto-Sleep module and an average accuracy of 59{\%} when performing on a reduced dataset generated using both the GPS Auto-Sleep module and the Critical Points algorithm.},

abstract = {Participatory Sensing (PS) is a new data collection paradigm based on the voluntary participation of many cellular users equipped with smart applications, a large diversity of sensors, and Internet connectivity at all times. Although many PS-based applications can be foreseen to solve interesting and useful problems, many of them have not been fully implemented and used in practice because of privacy concerns. Compounding the problem, privacy-preserving mechanisms introduce additional issues. For example, one of the most important problems is that of the quality of the information provided by the PS system to the final users. The problem is that, in order to protect the privacy of the users, most privacy-preserving mechanisms modify their real locations, which makes the reported data as if it had been measured from a different location, introducing noise or false information in the system and to the final users. Another important problem is that of the energy consumption. Privacy-preserving mechanisms consume extra energy and users are not very willing to use PS applications if they drain their batteries considerably faster. This paper proposes a hybrid privacy-preserving mechanism that combines anonymization, data obfuscation, and encryption techniques to increase the quality of information and privacy protection without increasing the energy consumption in a significant manner. A new algorithm is proposed that dynamically changes the cell sizes of the grid of the area of interest according to the variability of the variable of interest being measured and chooses different privacy-preserving mechanisms depending on the size of the cell. In small cells, where users can be identified easier, the algorithm uses encryption techniques to protect the privacy of the users and increase the quality of the information, as the reported location is the real location. On the other hand, anonymization and data obfuscation techniques are used in bigger cells where the variability of the variable of interest is low and therefore it is more important to protect the real location (privacy) of the user. We evaluated our hybrid approach and other privacy-preserving mechanisms using a real PS system for air pollution monitoring. Our experiments show the better performance of the proposed hybrid mechanism and the existing trade-offs in terms of privacy, quality of information to the final user, and energy consumption. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {An innovative approach to physical activity recognition based on the use of discrete variables obtained from accelerometer sensors is presented. The system first performs a discretization process for each variable, which allows efficient recognition of activities performed by users using as little energy as possible. To this end, an innovative discretization and classification technique is presented based on the 2 distribution. Furthermore, the entire recognition process is executed on the smartphone, which determines not only the activity performed, but also the frequency at which it is carried out. These techniques and the new classification system presented reduce energy consumption caused by the activity monitoring system. The energy saved increases smartphone usage time to more than 27 h without recharging while maintaining accuracy.},

abstract = {Location is a fundamental service for mobile computing. Typical GPS receivers, although widely available, consume too much energy to be useful for many applications. Observing that in many sensing scenarios, the location information can be post-processed when the data is uploaded to a server, we design a Cloud-Ofﬂoaded GPS (CO-GPS) solution that allows a sensing device to aggressively duty-cycle its GPS receiver and log just enough raw GPS signal for postprocessing. Leveraging publicly available information such as GNSS satellite ephemeris and an Earth elevation database, a cloud service can derive good quality GPS locations from a few milliseconds of raw data. Using our design of a portable sensing device platform called CLEO, we evaluate the accuracy and efﬁciency of the solution. Compared to more than 30 seconds of heavy signal processing on standalone GPS receivers, we can achieve three orders of magnitude lower energy consumption per location tagging.},

abstract = {Mobile phones play a pivotal role in supporting ubiquitous and unobtrusive sensing of human activities. However, maintaining a highly accurate record of a user's behavior throughout the day imposes significant energy demands on the phone's battery. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of METIS: an adaptive mobile sensing platform that efficiently supports social sensing applications. The platform implements a novel sensor task distribution scheme that dynamically decides whether to perform sensing on the phone or in the infrastructure, considering the energy consumption, accuracy, and mobility patterns of the user. By comparing the sensing distribution scheme with sensing performed solely on the phone or exclusively on the fixed remote sensors, we show, through benchmarks using real traces, that the opportunistic sensing distribution achieves over 60{\%} and 40{\%} energy savings, respectively. This is confirmed through a real world deployment in an office environment for over a month: we developed a social application over our frameworks, that is able to infer the collaborations and meetings of the users. In this setting the system preserves over 35{\%} more battery life over pure phone sensing.},

abstract = {A growing class of smartphone applications are tasking applications that run continuously, process data from sensors to determine the user's context (such as location) and activity, and optionally trigger certain actions when the right conditions occur. Many such tasking applications also involve coordination between multiple users or devices. Example tasking applications include location-based reminders, changing the ring-mode of a phone automatically depending on location, notifying when friends are nearby, disabling WiFi in favor of cellular data when moving at more than a certain speed outdoors, automatically tracking and storing movement tracks when driving, and inferring the number of steps walked each day. Today, these applications are non-trivial to develop, although they are often trivial for end users to state. Additionally, simple implementations can consume excessive amounts of energy. This paper proposes Code in the Air (CITA), a system which simplifies the rapid development of tasking applications. It enables non-expert end users to easily express simple tasks on their phone, and more sophisticated developers to write code for complex tasks by writing purely server-side scripts. CITA provides a task execution framework to automatically distribute and coordinate tasks, energy-efficient modules to infer user activities and compose them, and a push communication service for mobile devices that overcomes some shortcomings in existing push services.},

abstract = {Location-aware systems are proliferating on a variety of platforms from laptops to cell phones. Locations are expressed in two principal ways: coordinates and landmarks. However, users are often more interested in “places” rather than locations. A place is a locale that is important to an individual user and carries important semantic meanings such as being a place where one works, lives, plays, meets socially with others, etc. Our devices can make more intelligent decisions on how to behave when they have this higher level information. For example, a cell phone can switch to a silent mode when the user is in a quiet place (e.g., a movie theater, a lecture hall, or a place where one meets socially with others). It would be tedious to define this in terms of coordinates. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for extracting significant places from a trace of coordinates, and evaluate the algorithm with real data collected using Place Lab [14], a coordinate-based location system that uses a database of locations for WiFi hotspots.},

However, unlike devices that have a limited and predefined set of functionality, recent mobile smartphone devices have a very rich set of components and can handle multiple general purpose programs that are not apriori known or profiled. In this paper, we present a general methodology for collecting measurements and modelling power usage on smartphones. Our goal is to characterize the device subsystems and perform accurate power measurements. We implemented a system that effectively accounts for the power usage of all of the primary hardware subsystems on the phone: CPU, display, graphics, GPS, audio, microphone, and Wi-Fi. To achieve that, we make use of the per subsystem time shares reported by the operating system's power-management module. We present the models capability to further calculate the power consumption of individual applications given measurements, and also the feasibility of our model to operate in real-time and without significant impact in the power footprint of the devices we monitor.},

abstract = {Mobile applications often need location data, to update locally relevant information and adapt the device context. While most smartphones do include a GPS receiver, its frequent use is restricted due to high battery drain. We design and prototype an adaptive location service for mobile devices, a-Loc, that helps reduce this battery drain. Our design is based on the observation that the required location accuracy varies with location, and hence lower energy and lower accuracy localization methods, such as those based onWiFi and cell-tower triangulation, can sometimes be used. Our method automatically determines the dynamic accuracy requirement for mobile search-based applications. As the user moves, both the accuracy requirements and the location sensor errors change. A-Loc continually tunes the energy expenditure to meet the changing accuracy requirements using the available sensors. A Bayesian estimation framework is used to model user location and sensor errors. Experiments are performed with Android G1 and AT{\&}T Tilt phones, on paths that include outdoor and indoor locations, using war-driving data from Google and Microsoft. The experiments show that a-Loc not only provides significant energy savings, but also improves the accuracy achieved, because it uses multiple sensors.},

abstract = {Due to the significant advancement of Smartphone technology, the applications targeted for these devices are getting more and more complex and demanding of high power and resources. Mobile cloud computing (MCC) allows the Smart phones to perform these highly demanding tasks with the help of powerful cloud servers. However, to decide whether a given part of an application is cost-effective to execute in local mobile device or in the cloud server is a difficult problem in MCC. It is due to the trade-off between saving energy consumption while maintaining the strict latency requirements of applications. Currently, 5th generation mobile network (5G) is getting much attention, which can support increased network capacity, high data rate and low latency and can pave the way for solving the computation offloading problem in MCC. In this paper, we design an intelligent computation offloading system that takes tradeoff decisions for code offloading from a mobile device to cloud server over the 5G network. We develop a metric for tradeoff decision making that can maximize energy saving while maintain strict latency requirements of user applications in the 5G system. We evaluate the performances of the proposed system in a test-bed implementation, and the results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, computation and energy saving.},

abstract = {Languages like C{\#}, VB .NET, and Delphi include built-in support for events, and these events become very powerful when they connect the objects and components of a system. Events make it possible for such parts to interact without any coupling. And the resulting parts can be developed and tested individuallywhich keeps the code clean and simple. Component-based development (CBD) is an extension of object-oriented programming. CBD does away with the language and vendor-specific limitations of OOP, and makes software reuse more practical and accelerates the development process. Event-based programming is the next logical step in CBD, and makes components more reusable due to their decoupled nature. But event-based systems are easier to develop, which means theyre cheaper and more reliable than traditional OOP or CBD systems. This book teaches you how to develop software based on parts that interact primarily through an event mechanism. Youll learn how to use events in many different situations, to solve recurring development problems without coupling. The book introduces Signal Wiring Diagram, a novel form of software diagram similar to the circuit diagrams used by hardware designers. The book concludes with a series of case studies, incorporating all featured concepts. In a nutshell, youll want to pick up a copy of this book because it Provides source code in both C{\#} and VB .NET Shows how to use an event-based paradigm to reduce or completely eliminate coupling between classes and components Describes components, including coordinators, workers, builders, binders, and routers Contains three complete case studies that model concepts being used to design small, medium, and large systems},

abstract = {Many emerging location-aware applications require position information. However, these applications rarely use celltower-based localization because of its inaccuracy, preferring instead to use the more energy-hungry GPS. In this paper, we present CAPS, a Cell-ID Aided Positioning System. CAPS leverages near-continuous mobility and the position history of a user to achieve significantly better accuracy than the celltower-based approach, while keeping energy overhead low. CAPS is designed based on the insight that users exhibit consistency in routes traveled, and that cell-ID transition points that the user experiences can, on a frequently traveled route, uniquely identify position. To this end, CAPS uses a cell-ID sequence matching technique to estimate current position based on the history of cell-ID and GPS position sequences that match the current cell-ID sequence. We have implemented CAPS on Android-based smartphones and have extensively evaluated it at different locations, and for different platforms and carriers. Our evaluation results show that CAPS can save more than 90{\%} of the energy spent by the positioning system compared to the case where GPS is always used, while providing reasonably accurate position information with errors less than 20{\%} of the celltower-based scheme.},

abstract = {Mobile consumer-electronics devices, especially phones, are powered from batteries which are limited in size and therefore capacity. This implies that managing energy well is paramount in such devices. Good energy management requires a good understand- ing of where and how the energy is used. To this end we present a detailed analysis of the power consumption of a recent mobile phone, the Openmoko Neo Freerunner. We measure not only overall system power, but the exact breakdown of power consumption by the device's main hardware components. We present this power breakdown for micro-benchmarks as well as for a number of realis- tic usage scenarios. These results are validated by over- all power measurements of two other devices: the HTC Dream and Google Nexus One. We develop a power model of the Freerunner device and analyse the energy usage and battery lifetime under a number of usage patterns. We discuss the significance of the power drawn by various components, and identify themost promising areas to focus on for further improve- ments of power management. We also analyse the energy impact of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling of the device's application processor.},

abstract = {Understanding mobility is important for effective clinical decision making in the area of physical rehabilitation. Ideally, a person's mobility profile in a nonclinical setting, such as the home or community, could be obtained. This profile would include the environment and context in which the mobility takes place. This paper introduces a novel wearable mobility monitoring system (WMMS) for an objective ubiquitous measurement of mobility. This prototype WMMS was created using a smartphone-based approach that allowed for an all-in-one WMMS. The wearable system is freely worn on a person's belt, such as a normal phone. The WMMS was designed to monitor a user's mobility state and to take a photograph when a change of state was detected. These photographs were used to identify the context of mobility events (i.e., using an elevator, walking up/down stairs, and type of walking surface). Validation of the proposed WMMS was performed with five able-bodied subjects performing a structured sequence of mobility tasks. System performance was evaluated by its ability to detect changes of state and the ability to identify context from the photographs. The WMMS demonstrated good potential for community mobility monitoring.},

abstract = {The full degree of freedom in mobile systems heavily depends on the energy provided by the mobile phone's batteries. Their capacity is in general limited and for sure not keeping pace as the mobile devices are crammed up with new functionalities. The discrepancy of Moore's law, offering twice the processing power at least each second year, and the development in batteries, which did not even double over the last decade, makes a shift in researchers' way of designing networks, protocols, and the mobile device itself. The bottleneck to take care of in the design process of mobile systems is not only the wireless data rate, but even more the energy limitation as the customers ask for new energy-hungry services, e.g., requiring faster connections or even multiple air interfaces, and longer standby or operational times of their mobile devices at the same time. In this survey, the energy consuming entities of a mobile device such as wireless air interfaces, display, mp3 player and others are measured and compared. The presented measurement results allow the reader to understand what the energy hungry parts of a mobile device are and use those findings for the design of future mobile protocols and applications.

abstract = {As the availability and use of wearables increases, they are becoming a promising platform for context sensing and context analysis. Smartwatches are a particularly interesting platform for this purpose, as they offer salient advantages, such as their proximity to the human body. However, they also have limitations associated with their small form factor, such as processing power and battery life, which makes it difficult to simply transfer smartphone-based context sensing and prediction models to smartwatches. In this paper, we introduce an energy-efficient, generic, integrated framework for continuous context sensing and prediction on smartwatches. Our work extends previous approaches for context sensing and prediction on wrist-mounted wearables that perform predictive analytics outside the device. We offer a generic sensing module and a novel energy-efficient, on-device prediction module that is based on a semantic abstraction approach to convert sensor data into meaningful information objects, similar to human perception of a behavior. Through six evaluations, we analyze the energy efficiency of our framework modules, identify the optimal file structure for data access and demonstrate an increase in accuracy of prediction through our semantic abstraction method. The proposed framework is hardware independent and can serve as a reference model for implementing context sensing and prediction on small wearable devices beyond smartwatches, such as body-mounted cameras.},

As nonintrusive autonomous sensing and context recognition are desirable characteristics of a personal sensing system; efforts have been made to develop opportunistic sensing techniques on mobile phones. The resulting combination of these approaches has ushered in a new realm of applications, namely opportunistic user context recognition with mobile phones. This article surveys the existing research and approaches towards realization of such systems. In doing so, the typical architecture of a mobile-centric user context recognition system as a sequential process of sensing, preprocessing, and context recognition phases is introduced. The main techniques used for the realization of the respective processes during these phases are described, and their strengths and limitations are highlighted. In addition, lessons learned from previous approaches are presented as motivation for future research. Finally, several open challenges are discussed as possible ways to extend the capabilities of current systems and improve their real-world experience.},

@article{Suarez-Tangil2015,
abstract = {Many security problems in smartphones and other smart devices are approached from an anomaly detection perspective in which the main goal reduces to identifying anomalous activity patterns. Since machine learning algorithms are generally used to build such detectors, one major challenge is adapting these techniques to battery-powered devices. Many recent works simply assume that on-platform detection is prohibitive and suggest using offloaded (i.e., cloud-based) engines. Such a strategy seeks to save battery life by exchanging computation and communication costs, but it still remains unclear whether this is optimal or not in all circumstances. In this paper, we evaluate different strategies for offloading certain functional tasks in machine learning based detection systems. Our experimental results confirm the intuition that outsourced computation is clearly the best option in terms of power consumption, outweighing on-platform strategies in, essentially, all practical scenarios. Our findings also point out noticeable differences among different machine learning algorithms, and we provide separate consumption models for functional blocks (data preprocessing, training, test, and communications) that can be used to obtain power consumption estimates and compare detectors.},

abstract = {Users share a lot of personal information with friends, family members, and colleagues via social networks. Surprisingly, some users choose to share their sleeping patterns, perhaps both for awareness as well as a sense of connection lo others. Indeed, sharing basic sleep data, whether a person has gone to bed or waking up. In forms others about not just one's sleeping routines but also indicates physical stat. and reflects a sense of wellness. We present Somnometer, a social alarm clock for mobile phones that helps users to capture and share their sleep patterns. While the sleep rating is obtained from explicit user input the sleep duration is estimated based on monitoring a user's interactions with the app. Observing that many individuals currently utilize their mobile phone as an alarm clock revealed behavioral patterns that we were able to leverage when designing the app. We assess whether it is possible to reliably monitor one's sleep duration using such apps. We further investigate whether providing users with the ability to track their sleep behavior over a long time period can empower them to engage in healthier sleep habits. We hypothesize that sharing sleep information with social networks impacts awareness and connectedness among friends. The result from a controlled study reveals that it is feasible to monitor a user's sleep duration based just on her interactions with an alarm clock app on the mobile phone. The results from both an in-the-wild study and a controlled experiment suggest that providing a way for users to track their sleep behaviors increased user awareness of sleep patterns and induced healthier habits. However, we also found that, given the current broadcast nature of exiting social networks, users were concerned with sharing their sleep patterns indiscriminately. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, we introduce SmartDC, a mobility prediction-based adaptive duty cycling scheme to provide contextual information about a user'smo- bility: time-resolved places and paths. Unlike previous ap- proaches that focused on minimizing energy consumption for tracking rawcoordinates, we propose efficient techniques to maximize the accuracy of monitoring meaningful places with a given energy constraint. SmartDC comprises unsu- pervised mobility learner, mobility predictor, and Markov decision process-based adaptive duty cycling. SmartDC esti- mates the regularity of individual mobility and predicts resi- dence time at places to determine efficient sensing schedules. Our experiment results show that SmartDC consumes 81{\%} less energy than the periodic sensing schemes, and 87{\%} less energy than a scheme employing context-aware sensing, yet it still correctly monitors 80{\%} of a user's location changes within a 160-second delay.},

@article{Haykin2014,
abstract = {Cognitive dynamic systems provide a broadly defined platform, whereby engineering learns from cognitive neuroscience, and by the same token, cognitive neuroscience learns from engineering. The first part of the paper is of a tutorial nature, addressing recent advances in cognitive perception and cognitive control, which are the dual of each other. The study of cognitive perception, viewed from the perspective of Bayesian inference, starts with sparse coding, well known in neuroscience. However, sparse coding could become ill-posed, particularly when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. In such situations, stability is a necessary requirement, which can only be satisfied if there is sufficient information in the observables. To satisfy this requirement, the sparse-coding algorithm is augmented by the addition of information filtering (i.e., a special case of Bayesian filtering). Accordingly, the performance of sparse coding is improved under the influence of perceptual attention. This improvement enhances the cognitive perceptor to separate relevant information from irrelevant information. Next, moving into cognitive control, viewed from the perspective of Bellman's dynamic programming, two ideas are exploited: entropic state of the perceptor, and the definition of reward as an invertible function of two entropic states, namely, the current state and its immediate past value. The net result of building on these two ideas is a modified form of Bellman's dynamic programming, and, therefore, a new reinforcement learning algorithm, which not only outperforms traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, but also offers some highly desirable properties. Among them is a linear law of computational complexity, which is the best that it could be. The second part of the paper addresses two challenging problems: first, how to mediate between cognitive control and cognitive perception and, second, how to formulate a procedure for risk control. The first problem is resolved by - aking use of probabilistic reasoning, a branch of probability theory, which leads into the formulation of a probabilistic reasoning machine. With this mediation in place, the conditions for overall system stability are derived, thereby confirming the probabilistic reasoning machine as the overall system stabilizer. The second challenge is risk control, which is by far the most challenging of them all: In the presence of an unexpected disturbance in the environment, risk is brought under control by mimicking the predict and preadapt function, which is considered to be the overarching function in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. To be specific, motor control is expanded by the inclusion of a new preadaptive control mechanism, which involves two different sets of actions: One set is made up of possible actions identified by the policy in the motor control. The other set involves a window of experiences (i.e., optimal actions) gained in the past. In a novel way, by exploiting these two sets, we end up with a preadaptive control mechanism in the form of a closed-loop feedback structure, which brings with it control (executive) attention.},

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLARANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency},

abstract = {In the 1980s, power toolsets consisted of five or six power tools but were delivered with a single motor attachable to each of the tools. The tools themselves were motorless. At the time the rationale for this design was twofold: the motor was an expensive component and not replicating it saved money, and people did not need both their circular saw and their power drill at the same time. This approach has a long tradition and was also common, for example, with early electric kitchen appliances. Such systems have become uncommon. However, looking at current consumer electronics it seems that a similar trend might be emerging. This time the expensive and complex components are the user interface and the embedded processor. Hence, this component is shared among appliances.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of communication devices such as smartphones has led to the emergence of context-aware services that are able to respond to specific user activities or contexts. These services allow communication providers to develop new, added-value services for a wide range of applications such as social networking, elderly care and near-emergency early warning systems. At the core of these services is the ability to detect specific physical settings or the context a user is in, using either internal or external sensors. For example, using built-in accelerometers, it is possible to determine whether a user is walking or running at a specific time of day. By correlating this knowledge with GPS data, it is possible to provide specific information services to users with similar daily routines. This article presents a survey of the techniques for extracting this activity information from raw accelerometer data. The techniques that can be implemented in mobile devices range from classical signal processing techniques such as FFT to contemporary string-based methods. We present experimental results to compare and evaluate the accuracy of the various techniques using real data sets collected from daily activities.},

abstract = {The ever-increasing technological advances in embedded systems engineering, together with the proliferation of small-size sensor design and deployment, have enabled mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) to recognize daily occurring human based actions, activities and interactions. Therefore, inferring a vast variety of mobile device user based activities from a very diverse context obtained by a series of sensory observations has drawn much interest in the research area of ubiquitous sensing. The existence and awareness of the context provides the capability of being conscious of physical environments or situations around mobile device users, and this allows network services to respond proactively and intelligently based on such awareness. Hence, with the evolution of smartphones, software developers are empowered to create context aware applications for recognizing human-centric or community based innovative social and cognitive activities in any situation and from anywhere. This leads to the exciting vision of forming a society of ``Internet of Things" which facilitates applications to encourage users to collect, analyze and share local sensory knowledge in the purpose for a large scale community use by creating a smart network which is capable of making autonomous logical decisions to actuate environmental objects. More significantly, it is believed that introducing the intelligence and situational awareness into recognition process of human-centric event patterns could give a better understanding of human behaviors, and it also could give a chance for proactively assisting individuals in order to enhance the quality of lives. Mobile devices supporting emerging computationally pervasive applications will constitute a significant part of future mobile technologies by providing highly proactive services requiring continuous monitoring of user related contexts. However, the middleware services provided in mobile devices have limited resources in terms of power, memory and bandwidth as compared to the capabilities of PCs and servers. Above all, power concerns are major restrictions standing up to implementation of context-aware applications. These requirements unfortunately shorten device battery lifetimes due to high energy consumption caused by both sensor and processor operations. Specifically, continuously capturing user context through sensors imposes heavy workloads in hardware and computations, and hence drains the battery power rapidly. Therefore, mobile device batteries do not last a long time while operating sensor(s) constantly. In addition to that, the growing deployment of sensor technologies in mobile devices and innumerable software applications utilizing sensors have led to the creation of a layered system architecture (i.e., context aware middleware) so that the desired architecture can not only offer a wide range of user-specific services, but also respond effectively towards diversity in sensor utilization, large sensory data acquisitions, ever-increasing application requirements, pervasive context processing software libraries, mobile device based constraints and so on. Due to the ubiquity of these computing devices in a dynamic environment where the sensor network topologies actively change, it yields applications to behave opportunistically and adaptively without a priori assumptions in response to the availability of diverse resources in the physical world as well as in response to scalability, modularity, extensibility and interoperability among heterogeneous physical hardware. In this sense, this dissertation aims at proposing novel solutions to enhance the existing tradeoffs in mobile sensing between accuracy and power consumption while context is being inferred under the intrinsic constraints of mobile devices and around the emerging concepts in context-aware middleware framework.},

abstract = {Emergent location-aware applications often require tracking trajectories of mobile devices over a long period of time. To be useful, the tracking has to be energy-efficient to avoid having a major impact on the battery life of the mobile de vice. Furthermore, when trajectory information needs to be sent to a remote server, on-device simplification of the trajectories is needed to reduce the amount of data transmission. While there has recently been a lot of work on energy-efficient position tracking, the energy-efficient tracking of trajectories has not been addressed in previous work. In this paper we propose a novel on-device sensor management strategy and a set of trajectory updating protocols which intelligently determine when to sample different sensors (accelerometer, compass and GPS) and when data should be simplified and sent to a remote server. The system is configurable with regards to accuracy requirements and provides a unified framework for both position and trajectory tracking. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by emulation experiments on real world data sets collected from different modes of transportation (walking, running, biking and commuting by car) as well as by validating with a real-world deployment. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to provide considerable savings in the battery consumption compared to a state-of-the-art position tracking system while at the same time maintaining the accuracy of the resulting trajectory, i.e., support of specific accuracy requirements and different types of applications can be ensured.},

abstract = {Continuous sensing applications (e.g., mobile social networking ap- plications) are appearing on new sensor-enabled mobile phones such as the Ap- ple iPhone, Nokia and Android phones. These applications present significant challenges to the phone's operations given the phone's limited computational and energy resources and the need for applications to share real-time continu- ous sensed data with back-end servers. System designers have to deal with a trade-off between data accuracy (i.e., application fidelity) and energy constraints in the design of uploading strategies between phones and back-end servers. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of several tech- niques to optimize the information uploading process for continuous sensing on mobile phones.We analyze the cases of continuous and intermittent connectivity imposed by low-duty cycle design considerations or poor wireless network cov- erage in order to drive down energy consumption and extend the lifetime of the phone.We also show how location prediction can be integrated into this forecast- ing framework. We present the implementation and the experimental evaluation of these uploading techniques based on measurements from the deployment of a continuous sensing application on 20 Nokia N95 phones used by 20 people for a period of 2 weeks. Our results show that we can make significant energy savings while limiting the impact on the application fidelity,making continuous sensing a viable application for mobile phones. For example, we show that it is possible to achieve an accuracy of 80{\%} with respect to ground-truth data while saving 60{\%} of the traffic sent over-the-air.},

abstract = {Smartphone sensing and persuasive feedback design is enabling a new generation of wellbeing apps capable of automatically monitoring multiple aspects of physical and mental health. In this article, we present BeWell+ the next generation of the BeWell smartphone wellbeing app, which monitors user behavior along three health dimensions, namely sleep, physical activity, and social interaction. BeWell promotes improved behavioral patterns via feedback rendered as an ambient display on the smartphone's wallpaper. With BeWell+, we introduce new mechanisms to address key limitations of the original BeWell app; specifically, (1) community adaptive wellbeing feedback, which generalizes to diverse user communities (e.g., elderly, children) by promoting better behavior yet remains realistic to the user's lifestyle; and, (2) wellbeing adaptive energy allocation, which prioritizes monitoring fidelity and feedback responsiveness on specific health dimensions (e.g., sleep) where the user needs additional help. We evaluate BeWell+ with a 27 person, 19 day field trial. Our findings show that not only can BeWell+ operate successfully on consumer smartphones; but also users understand feedback and respond by taking steps towards leading healthier lifestyles. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The diverse range of wireless interfaces and sensors, and the increasing popularity of power-hungry applications that take advantage of these resources can reduce the battery life of mobile handhelds to few hours of operation. The research community, and operating system and hardware vendors found interesting optimisations and techniques to extend the battery life of mobile phones. However, the state of the art of lithium-ion batteries clearly indicates that energy efficiency must be achieved both at the hardware and software level. In this survey, we will cover the software solutions that can be found in the research literature between 1999 and May 2011 at six different levels: energy-aware operating systems, efficient resource management, the impact of users' interaction patterns with mobile devices and applications, wireless interfaces and sensors management, and finally the benefits of integrating mobile devices with cloud computing services.},

abstract = {Large-scale urban sensing data such as mobile phone traces are emerging as an important data source for urban modeling. This study represents a first step towards building a methodology whereby mobile phone data can be more usefully applied to transportation research. In this paper, we present techniques to extract useful mobility information from the mobile phone traces of millions of users to investigate individual mobility patterns within a metropolitan area. The mobile-phone-based mobility measures are compared to mobility measures computed using odometer readings from the annual safety inspections of all private vehicles in the region to check the validity of mobile phone data in characterizing individual mobility and to identify the differences between individual mobility and vehicular mobility. The empirical results can help us understand the intra-urban variation of mobility and the non-vehicular component of overall mobility. More importantly, this study suggests that mobile phone trace data represent a reasonable proxy for individual mobility and show enormous potential as an alternative and more frequently updatable data source and a compliment to the conventional travel surveys in mobility study. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Rachuri2014,
abstract = {Mobile phones play a pivotal role in supporting ubiquitous and unobtrusive sensing of human activities. However, maintaining a highly accurate record of a user's behavior throughout the day imposes significant energy demands on the phone's battery. In this work, we investigate a new approach that can lead to significant energy savings for mobile applications that require continuous sensing of social activities. This is achieved by opportunistically offloading sensing to sensors embedded in the environment, leveraging sensing that may be available in typical modern buildings (e.g., room occupancy sensors, RFID access control systems). In this article, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of METIS: an adaptive mobile sensing platform that efficiently supports social sensing applications. The platform implements a novel sensor task distribution scheme that dynamically decides whether to perform sensing on the phone or in the infrastructure, considering the energy consumption, accuracy, and mobility patterns of the user. By comparing the sensing distribution scheme with sensing performed solely on the phone or exclusively on the fixed remote sensors, we show, through benchmarks using real traces, that the opportunistic sensing distribution achieves over 60{\%} and 40{\%} energy savings, respectively. This is confirmed through a real world deployment in an office environment for over a month: we developed a social application over our frameworks, that is able to infer the collaborations and meetings of the users. In this setting the system preserves over 35{\%} more battery life over pure phone sensing. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we propose to leverage cloud-assisted collaborative sensing to reduce sensing energy consumption for mobile phone sensing applications. We formally define a minimum energy sensing scheduling problem and present a polynomial-time algorithm to obtain optimal solutions, which can be used to show energy savings that can potentially be achieved by using collaborative sensing in mobile phone sensing applications, and can also serve as a benchmark for performance evaluation. We also address individual energy consumption and fairness by presenting an algorithm to find fair energy-efficient sensing schedules. Under realistic assumptions, we present two practical and effective heuristic algorithms to find energy-efficient sensing schedules. It has been shown by simulation results based on real energy consumption (measured by the Monsoon power monitor) and location (collected from the Google Map) data that collaborative sensing significantly reduces energy consumption compared to a traditional approach without collaborations, and the proposed heuristic algorithm performs well in terms of both total energy consumption and fairness.},

Activity recognition becomes one of the important issues for user adaptive services on the mobile phones.

We present a method to recognize a person's activities from sensors in a mobile phone using mixture-of-experts (ME) model. In order to train the ME model, we have applied global-local co-training (GLCT) algorithm with both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance. The GLCT is a variation of co-training that uses a global model and a local model together. To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed method, we have conducted experiments using real datasets collected from Google Android smartphones.

abstract = {An important feature of a modern mobile device is that it can position itself. Not only for use on the device but also for remote applications that require tracking of the device. To be useful, such position tracking has to be energy-efficient to avoid having a major impact on the battery life of the mobile device. Furthermore, tracking has to robustly deliver position updates when faced with changing conditions such as delays due to positioning and communication, and changing positioning accuracy. This work proposes EnTracked - a system that, based on the estimation and prediction of system conditions and mobility, schedules position updates to both minimize energy consumption and optimize robustness. The realized system tracks pedestrian targets equipped with GPS-enabled devices. The system is configurable to realize different trade-offs between energy consumption and robustness. We provide extensive experimental results by profiling how devices consume power, by emulation on collected data and by validation in several real-world deployments. Results from this profiling show how a device consumes power while tracking its position. Results from the emulation indicate that the system can estimate and predict system conditions and mobility. Furthermore they provide evidence for that the system can lower the energy consumption considerably and remain robust when faced with changing system conditions. By validation in several real-world deployments we provide evidence that the real system works as predicted by the emulation.},

First, user location points are grouped using a time-based clustering technique which discovers stay points while dealing with missing location data. The second level performs clustering on the stay points to obtain stay regions. A grid-based clustering algorithm has been used for this purpose. To obtain more user location points, a client-server system has been installed on the mobile phones, which is able to obtain location information by integrating GPS, Wifi, GSM and accelerometer sensors, among others.

Many issues must be addressed before mobile phones become a viable platform for remote health monitoring, including: security, reliability, privacy, and, most importantly, energy. Mobile phones are battery-operated, making energy a critical resource that must be carefully managed to ensure the longest running time before the battery is depleted. In a sense, all other issues are secondary, since the mobile phone will simply not function without energy. In this project, we therefore focus on understanding the energy consumption of a mobile phone that runs MIT wockets, physical activity monitoring applications, and consider ways to reduce its energy consumption.},

abstract = {Despite the growing popularity of mobile web browsing, the energy consumed by a phone browser while surfing the web is poorly understood. We present an infrastructure for measuring the precise energy used by a mobile browser to render web pages. We then measure the energy needed to render financial, e-commerce, email, blogging, news and social networking sites. Our tools are sufficiently precise to measure the energy needed to render individual web elements, such as cascade style sheets (CSS), Javascript, images, and plug-in objects. Our results show that for popular sites, downloading and parsing cascade style sheets and Javascript consumes a significant fraction of the total energy needed to render the page. Using the data we collected we make concrete recommendations on how to design web pages so as to minimize the energy needed to render the page. As an example, by modifying scripts on the Wikipedia mobile site we reduced by 30{\%} the energy needed to download and render Wikipedia pages with no change to the user experience. We conclude by estimating the point at which offloading browser computations to a remote proxy can save energy on the phone.},

abstract = {The current proliferation of mobile devices has resulted in a large diversity of designs, each optimized for a specific application, form-factor, battery life, and functionality (e.g., cell phone, pager, MP3 player, PDA, laptop). Recent trends, motivated by user preferences towards carrying less, have focused on integrating these different applications in a single general-purpose device, often resulting in much higher energy consumption and consequently much reduced battery life. This paper argues that in order to achieve longer battery life, such systems should be designed to include requirements-aware energy scale-down techniques . Such techniques would allow a general-purpose device to use hardware mechanisms and software policies to adapt energy use to the user's requirements for the task at hand, potentially approaching the low energy use of a special-purpose device. We make two main contributions. We first provide a model for energy scale-down. We argue that one approach to design scale-down is to use special-purpose devices as examples of powerefficient design points, and structure adaptivity using insights from these design points. To understand the magnitude of the potential benefits, we present an energy comparison of a wide spectrum of mobile devices (to the best of our knowledge, the first study to do so). A comparison of these devices with general- purpose systems helps us identify scale-down opportunities. Based on these insights, we propose and evaluate three specific requirements-aware energy scale-down optimizations, in the context of the display, wireless, and CPU components of the system. Our optimizations reduce the energy consumption of their targeted subsystems by factors of 2 to 10 demonstrating the importance of energy scale-down in future designs.},

Pervasive and ubiquitous computing need such strategies to mature as a discipline and to enable researchers to objectively assess and compare new techniques' contributions. Researchers have shown that evaluating ubiquitous systems can be difficult, so approaches tend to be subjective, piecemeal, or both. To ensure that the validity and usability of proposed systems won't be compromised, researchers must reach consensus on a set of standard evaluation methods for ubiquitous systems. Otherwise, methods for scientifically testing and presenting state-of-the-art advances will remain unclear.

The proposed approach profiles and analyzes the battery usage pattern of each task dynamically, and preserves the energy budget for operation of prioritized tasks for a guaranteed time. In addition, this paper proposes an energyconstrained scheduler that limits the energy consumption of tasks while preserving scheduling patterns, which translates to the QoS. The suggested scheme is implemented in a commercial smartphone and evaluated. The evaluation showed that the proposed scheme successfully provides guaranteed operation time for prioritized tasks.},

abstract = {The disruptive innovation of smartphone technology has enabled the development of mobile sensing applications leveraged on specialized sensors embedded in the device. These novel mobile phone applications rely on advanced sensor information processes, which mainly involve raw data acquisition, feature extraction, data interpretation and transmission. However, the continuous accessing of sensing resources to acquire sensor data in smartphones is still very expensive in terms of energy, particularly due to the periodic use of power-intensive sensors, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The key underlying idea to design energy-efficient schemes is to control the duty cycle of the GPS receiver. However, adapting the sensing rate based on dynamic context changes through a flexible middleware has received little attention in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel modular middleware architecture and runtime environment to directly interface with application programming interfaces (APIs) and embedded sensors in order to manage the duty cycle process based on energy and context aspects. The proposed solution has been implemented in the Android software stack. It allows continuous location tracking in a timely manner and in a transparent way to the user. It also enables the deployment of sensing policies to appropriately control the sampling rate based on both energy and perceived context. We validate the proposed solution taking into account a reference location-based service (LBS) architecture. A cloud-based storage service along with online mobility analysis tools have been used to store and access sensed data. Experimental measurements demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our middleware, in terms of energy and location resolution.},

abstract = {Energy consumption is a major concern in context-aware smartphone sensing. This paper first studies mobile device-based battery modeling, which adopts the kinetic battery model (KiBaM), under the scope of battery non-linearities with respect to variant loads. Second, this paper models the energy consumption behavior of accelerometers analytically and then provides extensive simulation results and a smartphone application to examine the proposed sensor model. Third, a Markov reward process is integrated to create energy consumption profiles, linking with sensory operations and their effects on battery non-linearity. Energy consumption profiles consist of different pairs of duty cycles and sampling frequencies during sensory operations. Furthermore, the total energy cost by each profile is represented by an accumulated reward in this process. Finally, three different methods are proposed on the evolution of the reward process, to present the linkage between different usage patterns on the accelerometer sensor through a smartphone application and the battery behavior. By doing this, this paper aims at achieving a fine efficiency in power consumption caused by sensory operations, while maintaining the accuracy of smartphone applications based on sensor usages. More importantly, this study intends that modeling the battery non-linearities together with investigating the effects of different usage patterns in sensory operations in terms of the power consumption and the battery discharge may lead to discovering optimal energy reduction strategies to extend the battery lifetime and help a continual improvement in context-aware mobile services.+12pt},

abstract = {Abstract The rapidly enhancing sensing capabilities of smartphones are enabling the development of a wide range of innovative mobile sensing applications that are impacting on everyday life of mobile users. However, supporting long-term sensing applications is challenging because of their key requirements for continuous access to embedded sensors for gathering raw data, which can deplete the device's battery in a few hours. This problem is expected to remain in the near future because the improvements on the capacity of batteries are coming at a slower pace than those advances in computing and sensing capabilities. The research community has highlighted the need for power-aware and context-aware sensing techniques deployed at different levels of mobile platforms for making a more efficient use of energy resources. Previous studies have analyzed the optimization of power consumption in mobile devices over different critical axes, like data transmission, computing, and hardware design. However, a comprehensive study focused in the challenges of power-aware smartphone-based sensing and strategies for addressing them has not been produced yet. This survey aims to fill this void with a particular focus on mobility sensing systems (e.g., human activity recognition, location-based services), presenting a comprehensive review of relevant strategies aimed at solving this issue. Also, this survey defines a taxonomy for such solutions, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Finally, most relevant open challenges and trends are discussed for providing insights for future research in the field.},

abstract = {The discovery of a person's meaningful places involves obtaining the physical locations and their labels for a person's places that matter to his daily life and routines. This problem is driven by the requirements from emerging location-aware applications, which allow a user to pose queries and obtain information in reference to places, for example, “home”, “work” or “Northwest Health Club”. It is a challenge to map from physical locations to personally meaningful places due to a lack of understanding of what constitutes the real users' personally meaningful places. Previous work has explored algorithms to discover personal places from location data. However, we know of no systematic empirical evaluations of these algorithms, leaving designers of location-aware applications in the dark about their choices. Our work remedies this situation. We extended a clustering algorithm to discover places. We also defined a set of essential evaluation metrics and an interactive evaluation framework. We then conducted a large-scale experiment that collected real users' location data and personally meaningful places, and illustrated the utility of our evaluation framework. Our results establish a baseline that future work can measure itself against. They also demonstrate that that our algorithm discovers places with reasonable accuracy and outperforms the well-known K-Means clustering algorithm for place discovery. Finally, we provide evidence that shapes more complex than “points” are required to represent the full range of people's everyday places. Categories},

abstract = {We present a recommender for taxi drivers and people ex- pecting to take a taxi, using the knowledge of 1) passen- gers' mobility patterns and 2) taxi drivers' pick-up behav- iors learned from the GPS trajectories of taxicabs. First, this recommender provides taxi drivers with some locations and the routes to these locations, towards which they are more likely to pick up passengers quickly (during the routes or at these locations) and maximize the profit. Second, it rec- ommends people with some locations (within a walking dis- tance) where they can easily find vacant taxis. In our method, we learn the above knowledge (represented by probabilities) from GPS trajectories of taxis. Then, we feed the knowledge into a probabilistic model which estimates the profit of the candidate locations for a particular driver based on where and when the driver requests for the recommendation. We validate our recommender using historical trajectories gen- erated by over 12,000 taxis during 110 days.

Our research into apps for autistic children identified that none of the apps use the full potential offered by mobile technology and sensors to overcome one of autistic children's main difficulty: the identification and expression of emotions. This paper describes a mobile app called CaptureMyEmotion that enables autistic children to take photos, videos or sounds, and at the same time senses their arousal level using a wireless sensor. It also allows the child to comment on their emotion at the time of capture. The app has the potential to help autistic children improve their emotions learning based on their own pictures, videos or sounds.

The underlying design principles of the proposed framework involve substitution, suppression, piggybacking, and adaptation of applications' location-sensing requests to conserve energy. We implement these design principles on Android-based smartphones as a middleware.

Rather than exposing real-world data and functionality through vertical system designs, we propose to make them an integral part of the Web. As a result, smart things become easier to build upon. In such an architecture, popular Web technologies (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, PHP, Ruby) can be used to build applications involving smart things, and users can leverage well-known Web mechanisms (e.g., browsing, searching, bookmarking, caching, linking) to interact with and share these devices. In this chapter, we describe the Web of Things (WoT) architecture and best practices based on the RESTful principles that have already contributed to the popular success, scalability, and evolvability of the Web. We discuss several prototypes using these principles, which connect environmental sensor nodes, energy monitoring systems, and RFID-tagged objects to the Web. We also show how Web-enabled smart things can be used in lightweight ad-hoc applications, called “physical Mashups”, and discuss some of the remaining challenges towards the global World Wide Web of Things.},

In this paper, we propose the novel notion of individual life pattern, which captures individual's general life style and regularity. Concretely, we propose the life pattern normal form (the LP-normal form) to formally describe which kind of life regularity can be discovered from location history; then we propose the LP-Mine framework to effectively retrieve life patterns from raw individual GPS data. Our definition of life pattern focuses on significant places of individual life and considers diverse properties to combine the significant places. LP-Mine is comprised of two phases: the modelling phase and the mining phase. The modelling phase pre-processes GPS data into an available format as the input of the mining phase. The mining phase applies separate strategies to discover different types of pattern. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using GPS data collected by volunteers in the real world to verify the effectiveness of the framework.},

abstract = {To provide more sophisticated healthcare services, it is necessary to collect the precise information on a patient. One impressive area of study to obtain meaningful information is human activity recognition, which has proceeded through the use of supervised learning techniques in recent decades. Previous studies, however, have suffered from generating a training dataset and extending the number of activities to be recognized. In this paper, to find out a new approach that avoids these problems, we propose unsupervised learning methods for human activity recognition, with sensor data collected from smartphone sensors even when the number of activities is unknown. Experiment results show that the mixture of Gaussian exactly distinguishes those activities when the number of activities k is known, while hierarchical clustering or DBSCAN achieve above 90{\%} accuracy by obtaining k based on Cali{\'{n}}ski-Harabasz index, or by choosing appropriate values for and MinPts when k is unknown. We believe that the results of our approach provide a way of automatically selecting an appropriate value of k at which the accuracy is maximized for activity recognition, without the generation of training datasets by hand. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {User mobility has given rise to a variety of Web applications, in which the global positioning system (GPS) plays many important roles in bridging between these applications and end users. As a kind of human behavior, transportation modes, such as walking and driving, can provide pervasive computing systems with more contextual information and enrich a user's mobility with informative knowledge. In this article, we report on an approach based on supervised learning to automatically infer users' transportation modes, including driving, walking, taking a bus and riding a bike, from raw GPS logs. Our approach consists of three parts: a change point-based segmentation method, an inference model and a graph-based post-processing algorithm. First, we propose a change point-based segmentation method to partition each GPS trajectory into separate segments of different transportation modes. Second, from each segment, we identify a set of sophisticated features, which are not affected by differing traffic conditions (e.g., a person's direction when in a car is constrained more by the road than any change in traffic conditions). Later, these features are fed to a generative inference model to classify the segments of different modes. Third, we conduct graph-based postprocessing to further improve the inference performance. This postprocessing algorithm considers both the commonsense constraints of the real world and typical user behaviors based on locations in a probabilistic manner. The advantages of our method over the related works include three aspects. (1) Our approach can effectively segment trajectories containing multiple transportation modes. (2) Our work mined the location constraints from user-generated GPS logs, while being independent of additional sensor data and map information like road networks and bus stops. (3) The model learned from the dataset of some users can be applied to infer GPS data from others. Using the GPS logs collected by 65 people over a period of 10 months, we evaluated our approach via a set of experiments. As a result, based on the change-point-based segmentation method and Decision Tree-based inference model, we achieved prediction accuracy greater than 71 percent. Further, using the graph-based post-processing algorithm, the performance attained a 4-percent enhancement.},

As a result, new applications have recently appeared to address large-scale societal problems as well as improve the quality of life of the individual. However, these new applications, recently called location-based services, participatory sensing, and human-centric sensing, bring many new challenges, one of them being the management of the huge amount of traffic (data) they generate. This article presents G-Sense, for Global-Sense, an architecture that integrates mobile and static wireless sensor networks in support of location-based services, participatory sensing, and human-centric sensing applications.

abstract = {Rich Mobile Applications (RMAs) comprise a budding research area receiving increasingly abundant attention from the academic and industrial communities. RMAs are deemed to be a candidate blueprint of future online smartphone applications aiming to deliver high functionalities and rich immersive experience to mobile users. RMAs are still in early stages and comprehensive survey of the domain is lacking. In this paper, we use structuralism and functionalism paradigms to analyze RMAs' origins, trends, and characteristics. RMAs are distinguished from traditional mobile applications and Rich Internet Applications (RIAs). Comprehending the distinction between delivering Rich User eXperience (RUX) in desktop and mobile computers, and the inward similarities and dissimilarities between RMAs and RIAs will facilitate and accelerate the development of rich, smartphone-centric applications. We analyze several problems inhibiting the adoption of RMAs and review corresponding solutions to devise a taxonomy. Our study advocates that the majority of problems stem from the intrinsic characteristics of mobile devices and the heterogeneity in this environment, especially when cloud computing is employed to enhance mobile computing. Several open issues on RMAs' domination and adoption are presented as future research directions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We propose WalkSafe, an Android smartphone application that aids people that walk and talk, improving the safety of pedestrian mobile phone users. WalkSafe uses the back camera of the mobile phone to detect vehicles approaching the user, alerting the user of a potentially unsafe situation; more specifically WalkSafe i) uses machine learning algo- rithms implemented on the phone to detect the front views and back views of moving vehicles and ii) exploits phone APIs to save energy by running the vehicle detection algo- rithm only during active calls. We present our initial design, implementation and evaluation of the WalkSafe App that is capable of real-time detection of the front and back views of cars, indicating cars are approaching or moving away from the user, respectively. WalkSafe is implemented on Android phones and alerts the user of unsafe conditions using sound and vibration from the phone. WalkSafe is available on An- droid Market.},

abstract = {Smartphone applications' energy efficiency is vital, but many Android applications suffer from serious energy ineffi-ciency problems. Locating these problems is labor-intensive and automated diagnosis is highly desirable. However, a key chal-lenge is the lack of a decidable criterion that facilitates automated judgment of such energy problems. Our work aims to address this challenge. We conducted an in-depth study of 173 open-source and 229 commercial Android applications, and observed two common causes of energy problems: missing deactivation of sensors or wake locks, and cost-ineffective use of sensory da-ta. With these findings, we propose an automated approach to diagnosing energy problems in Android applications. Our ap-proach explores an application's state space by systematically executing the application using Java PathFinder (JPF). It moni-tors sensor and wake lock operations to detect missing deactivation of sensors and wake locks. It also tracks the transformation and usage of sensory data and judges whether they are effectively utilized by the application using our state-sensitive data utili-zation metric. In this way, our approach can generate detailed reports with actionable information to assist developers in validat-ing detected energy problems. We built our approach as a tool, GreenDroid, on top of JPF. Technically, we addressed the chal-lenges of generating user interaction events and scheduling event handlers in extending JPF for analyzing Android applications. We evaluated GreenDroid using 13 real-world popular Android applications. GreenDroid completed energy efficiency diagnosis for these applications in a few minutes. It successfully located real energy problems in these applications, and additionally found new unreported energy problems that were later confirmed by developers.},

Most prior sensor-network research has focused on collecting and processing environmental data using a static topology and an application-aware infrastructure, whereas opportunistic sensing involves collecting, storing, processing and fusing large volumes of data related to everyday human activities. This highly dynamic and mobile setting, where humans are the central focus, presents new challenges for information security, because data originates from sensors carried by people— not tiny sensors thrown in the forest or attached to animals. In this paper we aim to instigate discussion of this critical issue, because opportunistic people- centric sensing will never succeed without adequate provisions for security and privacy. To that end, we outline several important challenges and suggest general solutions that hold promise in this new sensing paradigm.},

abstract = {Many emerging smartphone applications require position information to provide location-based or context-aware services. In these applications, GPS is often preferred over its alternatives such as GSM/WiFi based positioning systems because it is known to be more accurate. However, GPS is extremely power hungry. Hence a common approach is to periodically duty-cycle GPS. However, GPS duty-cycling trades-off positioning accuracy for lower energy. A key requirement for such applications, then, is a positioning system that provides accurate position information while spending minimal energy. In this paper, we present RAPS, rate-adaptive positioning system for smartphone applications. It is based on the observation that GPS is generally less accurate in urban areas, so it suffices to turn on GPS only as often as necessary to achieve this accuracy. RAPS uses a collection of techniques to cleverly determine when to turn on GPS. It uses the location-time history of the user to estimate user velocity and adaptively turn on GPS only if the estimated uncertainty in position exceeds the accuracy threshold. It also efficiently estimates user movement using a duty-cycled accelerometer, and utilizes Bluetooth communication to reduce position uncertainty among neighboring devices. Finally, it employs celltower-RSS blacklisting to detect GPS unavailability (e.g., indoors) and avoid turning on GPS in these cases. We evaluate RAPS through real-world experiments using a prototype implementation on a modern smartphone and show that it can increase phone lifetimes by more than a factor of 3.8 over an approach where GPS is always on.},

Beyond this definition, smart sensors are defined as the combination of a sensor with signal conditioning, embedded algorithms and digital interface. They are currently highly adopted in mobile and portable devices like phones and tablets. Such types of sensors respond to the issues of power consumption, data communication and system integration at the sensor level and for predefined use cases. Some limitations of smart sensors are the lack of flexibility, absence of customization, narrow spectrum of applications, and the basic communication protocol. Moreover, there is a growing request of new and broader applications for individual sensors while integrating an increasing number of different types of sensors. Therefore, to overcome these limitations and address the new challenges, the next generation of sensors is proposed: the intelligent sensor platform. It is defined as the combination of sensor and processing with a dedicated architecture to aggregate external sensor data. The main advantages are reviewed and an implementation of an intelligent sensor platform embedding a MEMS accelerometer with a 32-bit microcontroller is described.},

Indeed, MSN enhances the capabilities of more traditional Online Social Networking (OSN) to a great extent by enabling mobile users to benefit from opportunistically created social communities; these communities should be determined not only by common interests or contacts but also by mobility-related context, such as physical location and co-presence. In this paper we precisely define what we intend for MSN applications and overview the primary MSN support solutions available in the current literature and that specifically address the underlying technical challenges, design issues, and emerging middleware guidelines. Our primary goal is to identify engineering design criteria for future MSN middleware solutions, capable to flexibly adapt to different application domains and deployment requirements. To this purpose, we present a novel taxonomy of MSN structures and describe how various existing middleware approaches fit the proposed classification; moreover, the survey takes the opportunity of these descriptions to discuss related middleware design/implementation choices determining specific tradeoffs between expressive power, flexibility, and scalability. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {One of the most obvious technologies behind Location Based Services (LBS) is positioning, with the most widely recognized system being the Global Positioning System (GPS). There are, however, other means of positioning in addition to GPS. These other technologies are network based positioning and typically rely on various means of triangulation of the signal from cell sites serving a mobile phone. In addition, the serving cell site can be used as a fix for location of the user. More and more organizations have started to apply location-based services over Wireless LANs to enable improvements to applications. Generally, a LBS keeps track of the position of users on the network as they roam through the facility. A central system collects and integrates this position information to drive additional functions that identify the position of users in relation to the facility and pertinent areas, such as information on hospitals and medical centers, booths, emergency centers, stores, police stations, gas stations, etc. LBSs offer personalized services to the subscribers based on their current position using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Geographic Information System (GIS) and Wireless Communications and Networking technologies. LBSs offer modern world the tool for efficient management and continuous control. More and more people involve LBS in their industry and day-to-day life to better achieve their goals. In this paper, we present a review of LBS using Geographical Information Systems and two applications that we developed. These are automatic vehicle location, which can provide better management and control for a moving fleet of vehicles and police traffic information system. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The capacity to gather and timely deliver to the service level any relevant information that can characterize the service-provisioning environment, such as computing resources/capabilities, physical device location, user preferences, and time constraints, usually defined as context-awareness, is widely recognized as a core function for the development of modern ubiquitous and mobile systems. Much work has been done to enable context-awareness and to ease the diffusion of context-aware services; at the same time, several middleware solutions have been designed to transparently implement context management and provisioning in the mobile system. However, to the best of our knowledge, an in-depth analysis of the context data distribution, namely, the function in charge of distributing context data to interested entities, is still missing. Starting from the core assumption that only effective and efficient context data distribution can pave the way to the deployment of truly context-aware services, this article aims at putting together current research efforts to derive an original and holistic view of the existing literature. We present a unified architectural model and a new taxonomy for context data distribution by considering and comparing a large number of solutions. Finally, based on our analysis, we draw some of the research challenges still unsolved and identify some possible directions for future work.},

abstract = {Limiting the energy consumption of computers, especially portables, is becoming increasingly important. Thus, new energy-saving computer components and architectures have been and continue to be developed. Many architectural features have both high-performance and low-power modes, with the mode selection under software control. The problem is to minimize energy consumption while not significantly impacting the effective performance. We group the software control issues as follows: transition, load-change, and adaptation. The transition problem is deciding when to switch to low-power, reduced-functionality modes. The load-change problem is determining how to modify the load on a component so that it can make further use of its low-power modes. The adaptation problem is determining how to create software that allows components to be used in novel, power-saving ways. We survey implemented and proposed solutions to software energy management issues created by existing and suggested hardware innovations},

abstract = {Location information is a key element of participatory sensing. Many mobile and sensing applications require location information to provide better recommendations, object search and trip planning. However, continuous GPS positioning consumes much energy, which may drain the battery of mobile devices quickly. Although WiFi and cell tower positioning are alternatives, they provide lower accuracy compared to GPS. This paper solves the above problem by proposing a novel localization scheme through the collaboration of multiple mobile devices to reduce energy consumption and provide accurate positioning. Under our scheme, the mobile devices are divided into three groups, namely the broadcaster group, the location information receiver group and the normal participant group. Only the broadcaster group and the normal participant group use their GPS. The location information receiver group, on the other hand, makes use of the locations broadcast by the broadcaster group to estimate their locations. We formulate the broadcaster set selection problem and propose two novel algorithms to minimize the energy consumption in collaborative localization. Simulations with real traces show that our proposed solution can save up to 68{\%} of the energy of all of the participants and provide more accurate locations than WiFi and cellular network positioning.},

Innumerable applications can be visualized, for instance, in medical, security, entertainment, and tactical scenarios. Despite human activity recognition (HAR) being an active field for more than a decade, there are still key aspects that, if addressed, would constitute a significant turn in the way people interact with mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art in HAR based on wearable sensors. A general architecture is first presented along with a description of the main components of any HAR system. We also propose a two-level taxonomy in accordance to the learning approach (either supervised or semi-supervised) and the response time (either offline or online). Then, the principal issues and challenges are discussed, as well as the main solutions to each one of them. Twenty eight systems are qualitatively evaluated in terms of recognition performance, energy consumption, obtrusiveness, and flexibility, among others. Finally, we present some open problems and ideas that, due to their high relevance, should be addressed in future research.},

abstract = {The demand for an all-in-one phone with integrated personal information management and data access capabilities is beginning to accelerate. While personal digital assistants (PDAs) with built-in cellular, WiFi, and Voice-Over-IP technologies have the ability to serve these needs in a single package, the rate at which energy is consumed by PDA-based phones is very high. Thus, these devices can quickly drain their own batteries and become useless to their owner.In this paper, we introduce a technique to increase the battery lifetime of a PDA-based phone by reducing its idle power , the power a device consumes in a "standby" state. To reduce the idle power, we essentially shut down the device and its wireless network card when the device is not being used--the device is powered only when an incoming call is received. Using this technique, we can increase the battery lifetime by up to 115{\%}.In this paper, we describe the design of our "wake-on-wireless" energy-saving strategy and the prototype device we implemented. To evaluate our technique, we compare it with alternative approaches. Our results show that our technique can provide a significant lifetime improvement over other technologies.},

abstract = {Gathering and analyzing location data is an important part of many ubiquitous computing applications. The most common way to represent location information is to use numerical coordinates, e.g., latitudes and longitudes. A problem with this approach is that numerical coordinates are usually meaningless to a user and they contrast with the way humans refer to locations in daily communication. Instead of using coordinates, humans tend to use descriptive statements about their location; for example, ”I'm home” or ”I'm at Starbucks.” Locations, to which a user can attach meaningful and descriptive semantics, are often called places. In this paper we focus on the automatic extraction of places from discontinuous GPS measurements. We describe and evaluate a non-parametric Bayesian approach for identifying places from this kind of data. The main novelty of our approach is that the algorithm is fully automated and does not require any parameter tuning. Another novel aspect of our algorithm is that it can accurately identify places without temporal information. We evaluate our approach using data that has been gathered from different users and different geographic areas. The traces that we use exhibit different characteristics and contain data from daily life as well as from traveling abroad. We also compare our algorithm against the popular k-means algorithm. The results indicate that our method can accurately identify meaningful places from a variety of location traces and that the algorithm is robust against noise.},

abstract = {Much research focuses on predicting a person's geo-spatial traversal patterns using a history of recorded geo-coordinates. In this paper, we focus on the problem of predicting location-state transitions. Location-states for a user refer to a set of anchoring points/regions in space, and the prediction task produces a sequence of predicted location states for a given query time window. If this problem can be solved accurately and efficiently, it may lead to new location based services (LBS) that can smartly recommend information to a user based on his current and future location states. The proposed iLoc (Incremental (Location-State Acquisition and Prediction) framework solves the prediction problem by utilizing the sensor information provided by a user's mobile device. It incrementally learns the location states by constantly monitoring the signal environment of the mobile device. Further, the framework tightly integrates the learning and prediction modules, allowing iLoc to update location-states continuously and predict future location-states at the same time. Our extensive experiments show that the quality of the location-states learned by iLoc are better than the state-of-the-art. We also show that when other learners failed to produce reasonable predictions, iLoc provides good forecasts. As for the efficiency, iLoc processes the data in a single pass, which fits well to many data stream processing models. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of smartphones, participatory sensing using smartphones provides unprecedented opportunities for collecting enormous sensing data. There are two crucial requirements in participatory sensing, fair task allocation and energy efficiency, which are particularly challenging given high combinatorial complexity, tradeoff between energy efficiency and fairness, and dynamic and unpredictable task arrivals. In this paper, we present a novel fair energy-efficient allocation framework whose objective is characterized by min-max aggregate sensing time. We rigorously prove that optimizing the min-max aggregate sensing time is NP hard even when the tasks are assumed as a priori. We consider two allocation models: offline allocation and online allocation. For the offline allocation model, we design an efficient approximation algorithm with the approximation ratio of 2 - 1/m, where m is the number of member smartphones in the system. For the online allocation model, we propose a greedy online algorithm which achieves a competitive ratio of at most m. The results demonstrate that the approximation algorithm reduces over 81{\%} total sensing time, the greedy online algorithm reduces more than 73{\%} total sensing time, and both algorithms achieve over 3x better min-max fairness.},

abstract = {Today's mobile phones come with a rich set of built-in sensors such as accelerometers, ambient light sensors, compasses, and pressure sensors, which can measure various phenomena on and around the phone. Gathering user context such as user activity, geographic location, and location type requires continuous sampling of sensor data. However, such sampling shortens a phone's battery life because of the associated energy overhead. This article examines the root causes of this energy overhead and shows that energy-efficient continuous sensing can be achieved through proper system design.},

abstract = {It goes without saying that we are very content to publish this Clusterbook and to leave it today to your hands. The Cluster of European Research projects on the Internet of Things – CERP-IoT – comprises around 30 major research initiatives, platforms and networks work-ing in the field of identification technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification and in what could become tomorrow an Internet-connected and inter-connected world of objects. The book in front of you reports to you about the research and innovation issues at stake and demonstrates approaches and examples of possible solutions. If you take a closer look you will realise that the Cluster reflects exactly the ongoing developments towards a future Internet of Things – growing use of Identification technologies, massive deployment of simple and smart devices, increasing connection between objects and systems. Of course, many developments are less directly derived from the core research area but contribute significantly in creating the “big picture” and the paradigm change. We are also conscious to maintain Europe's strong position in these fields and the result being achieved, but at the same time to understand the challenges ahead as a global endeavour with our international partners. As it regards international co-operation, the cluster is committed to increasing the number of common activities with the existing international partners and to looking for various stakeholders in other countries. However, we are just at the beginning and, following the prognostics which predict 50 to 100 billion devices to be connected by 2020, the true research work starts now. The European Commission is decided to implement its Internet of Things policy for supporting an economic revival and providing better life to its citizens, and it has just selected from the last call for proposals several new Internet of Things research projects as part of the 7th Framework Programme on European Research. We wish you now a pleasant and enjoyable reading and would ask you to stay connected with us for the future. Special thanks are expressed to Harald Sundmaeker and his team who did a remarkable effort in assembling this Clusterbook.},

abstract = {This paper presents RTDroid, a variant of Android that provides predictability to Android applications. Although there has been much interest in adopting Android in real-time contexts, surprisingly little work has been done to examine the suitability of Android for real-time systems. Existing work only provides solutions to traditional problems, including real-time garbage collection at the virtual machine layer and kernel-level real-time scheduling and resource management. While it is critical to address these issues, it is by no means sufficient. After all, Android is a vast system that is more than a Java virtual machine and a kernel. Thus, this paper goes beyond existing work and examines the internals of Android. We discuss the implications and challenges of adapting Android constructs and core system services for real-time and present a solution for each. Our system is unique in that it redesigns Android's internal components, replaces Android's Java VM (Dalvik) with a real-time VM, and leverages off-the-shelf real-time OSes. We demonstrate the feasibility and predictability of our solution by evaluating it on three different platforms---an x86 PC, a LEON3 embedded board, and a Nexus S smartphone. The evaluation results show that our design can successfully provide predictability to Android applications, even under heavy load.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a measurement study of the energy consumption characteristics of three widespread mobile networking technologies: 3G, GSM, and WiFi. We find that 3G and GSM incur a high tail energy overhead because of lingering in high power states after completing a transfer. Based on these measurements, we develop a model for the energy consumed by network activity for each technology. Using this model, we develop TailEnder, a protocol that reduces energy consumption of common mobile applications. For applications that can tolerate a small delay such as e-mail, TailEnder schedules transfers so as to minimize the cumulative energy consumed while meeting user-specified deadlines. We show that the TailEnder scheduling algorithm is within a factor 2× of the optimal and show that any online algorithm can at best be within a factor 1.62× of the optimal. For applications like web search that can benefit from prefetching, TailEnder aggressively prefetches several times more data and improves user-specified response times while consuming less energy. We evaluate the benefits of TailEnder for three different case study applications-email, news feeds, and web search-based on real user logs and show significant reduction in energy consumption in each case. Experiments conducted on the mobile phone show that TailEnder can download 60{\%} more news feed updates and download search results for more than 50{\%} of web queries, compared to using the default policy.

These smartphones include a large set of hardware capabilities and sensors which allow to improve the user interaction and content delivery. The sensors allow to gather extra information about the user situation and therefore to create location {\&} context aware mobile apps. However, sensors usage involves energy consumption, which is also one of the smartphone's biggest limitations; in addition, these devices also have storage and memory constraints, and slow processors compared to a conventional computer. Recently, there is an emerging tendency consisting in lessen these limitations by implementing the complex computations and data storage in external entities such as cloud computing. This article presents the fundamentals for developing an energy-aware middleware for the support of context {\&} location aware mobile apps with cloud computing interaction. This middleware can increase up to three times the smartphone battery performance when using the GPS receiver, and in the cloud can perform the extraction of places of interest from a list of GPS fixes uploaded by the smartphone.},

abstract = {Traffic delays and congestion are a major source of inefficiency, wasted fuel, and commuter frustration. Measuring and localizing these delays, and routing users around them, is an important step towards reducing the time people spend stuck in traffic. As others have noted, the proliferation of commodity smartphones that can provide location estimates using a variety of sensors—GPS, WiFi, and/or cellular triangulation— opens up the attractive possibility of using position samples from drivers' phones to monitor traffic delays at a fine spatiotemporal granularity. This paper presents VTrack, a system for travel time estimation using this sensor data that addresses two key challenges: energy consumption and sensor unreliability. While GPS provides highly accurate location estimates, it has several limitations: some phones don't have GPS at all, the GPS sensor doesn't work in “urban canyons” (tall buildings and tunnels) or when the phone is inside a pocket, and the GPS on many phones is power-hungry and drains the battery quickly. In these cases, VTrack can use alternative, less energy-hungry but noisier sensors like WiFi to estimate both a user's trajectory and travel time along the route. VTrack uses a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based map matching scheme and travel time estimation method that interpolates sparse data to identify the most probable road segments driven by the user and to attribute travel times to those segments. We present experimental results from real drive data and WiFi access point sightings gathered from a deployment on several cars. We show that VTrack can tolerate significant noise and outages in these location estimates, and still successfully identify delay-prone segments, and provide accurate enough delays for delay-aware routing algorithms. We also study the best sampling strategies for WiFi and GPS sensors for different energy cost regimes.},

abstract = {Where is the energy spent inside my app? Despite the im- mense popularity of smartphones and the fact that energy is the most crucial aspect in smartphone programming, the answer to the above question remains elusive. This paper first presents eprof, the first fine-grained energy profiler for smartphone apps. Compared to profiling the runtime of ap- plications running on conventional computers, profiling en- ergy consumption of applications running on smartphones faces a unique challenge, asynchronous power behavior, where the effect on a component's power state due to a pro- gram entity lasts beyond the end of that program entity.We present the design, implementation and evaluation of eprof on two mobile OSes, Android andWindowsMobile. We then present an in-depth case study, the first of its kind, of six popular smartphones apps (including Angry- Birds, Facebook and Browser). Eprof sheds lights on inter- nal energy dissipation of these apps and exposes surprising findings like 65{\%}-75{\%} of energy in free apps is spent in third-party advertisement modules. Eprof also reveals sev- eral “wakelock bugs”, a family of “energy bugs” in smart- phone apps, and effectively pinpoints their location in the source code. The case study highlights the fact that most of the energy in smartphone apps is spent in I/O, and I/O events are clustered, often due to a few routines. This motivates us to propose bundles, a new accounting presentation of app I/O energy,which helps the developer to quickly understand and optimize the energy drain of her app. Using the bundle pre- sentation, we reduced the energy consumption of four apps by 20{\%}to 65{\%}.},

abstract = {For rehabilitation and diagnoses, an understanding of patient activities and movements is important. Modern smartphones have built in accelerometers which promise to enable quantifying minute-by-minute what patients do (e.g. walk or sit). Such a capability could inform recommendations of physical activities and improve medical diagnostics. However, a major problem is that during everyday life, we carry our phone in different ways, e.g. on our belt, in our pocket, in our hand, or in a bag. The recorded accelerations are not only affected by our activities but also by the phone's location. Here we develop a method to solve this kind of problem, based on the intuition that activities change rarely, and phone locations change even less often. A hidden Markov model (HMM) tracks changes across both activities and locations, enabled by a static support vector machine (SVM) classifier that probabilistically identifies activity-location pairs. We find that this approach improves tracking accuracy on healthy subjects as compared to a static classifier alone. The obtained method can be readily applied to patient populations. Our research enables the use of phones as activity tracking devices, without the need of previous approaches to instruct subjects to always carry the phone in the same location. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {With the prevalence of localization techniques in smartphones, location-based applications on mobiles have become increasingly popular. However, only minorities of applications can be triggered automatically by the predefined locations of interest without any human interaction. One reason is that the inevitable operation of location detection by GPS is power-intensive. While existing work has focused on energy efficiency in continuous location tracking, energy-efficient location detection for matching predefined location of interest remains to be further explored. This paper proposes a unified framework that supports energy-efficient location detection for automatic location-triggered applications. Our framework triggers desired events only when the user is approaching the predefined locations of interest. Besides the efforts we make to reduce the number of GPS updates by cooperating with other types of on-device sensors, the framework also aims to coordinate multiple location-triggered applications to further reduce energy consumption on location updates. We implemented our framework as a middleware in the Android operating system and conducted extensive real experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework can reduce the number of GPS requests and low the energy consumption of the smartphones significantly. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Smartphones enable the collection of fine-grained mobility data using various sensors. The key challenge in the collection of continuous data is to overcome the limited battery capacity of the device. While extensive research has been conducted to solve energy issues in continuous mobility learning, we argue that previous works have not reached optimal performance in real deployments. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient mobility monitoring system, FreeTrack, to collect fine-grained mobility data with minimum energy consumption in everyday life. We first analyzed the regularity of life patterns, cellular connection patterns, and battery charging behaviors of 94 smartphone users to examine important features related to human mobility. Based on our findings, we design an adaptive duty cycling scheme that uses zero-cost information (i.e., regular mobility, cell connection, and battery state) as low-level sensing to infer location change without the need to activate sensors. We model the location inference on the Hidden Markov Model and optimize the sensing schedule of individual smartphones for real-time operation. Our extensive experiment with 48 smartphone users shows that the proposed system achieves an energy saving of about 70{\%} over previous works, yet still correctly traces 97{\%} of mobility with 0.2�0.5 places misses in a day.},

abstract = {The ever increasing technological advances in embedded systems engineering, together with the proliferation of small-size sensor designs and deployment, have enabled smart devices to recognize daily human-based actions, activities, and interactions. Therefore, inferring a vast variety of user-device-based activities from diverse contexts obtained by a series of sensory observations has drawn much interest to the research area of ubiquitous sensing. The existence and awareness of context provides the capability of being conscious of physical environments or situations around users, and this allows network services to respond proactively and intelligently based on such awareness. Hence, with the evolution of smartphones, software developers have been empowered to create context-aware applications for recognizing human-centric or community based innovative social and cognitive activities in any situation and at any location. However, the middleware services provided in mobile devices have limited resources in terms of power, memory, and bandwidth compared to the capabilities of PCs and servers. Also, power is a major restriction on implementation of context-aware applications. Mobile device batteries do not last a long time while operating sensor(s) constantly. To this end, this article extensively surveys the emerging concepts of context awareness in mobile platforms by providing up-to-date literature and future research directives. We also point out the challenges faced in this regard and enlighten them by offering possible solutions.},
annote = {Defines that context aware mobile apps will lead to the IoT.


The key idea behind context-aware sensing applications is to encourage users to collect, analyze, and share much local sensory knowledge for large-scale community use by creating a knowledge network capable of making autonomous logical decisions to actuate environmental objects and also to assist individuals.


Human behavior highly depends on the per-ception, context, environment, and prior knowledge of most recent event patterns.




The key challenge faced by this concept is to
infer relevant activities in a system that takes
raw sensor readings initially and processes them
until obtaining a semantic outcome under some
constrictions.


The constrictions may come from modeling uncertainties in data due to saving energy wasted during physical sensor operations (aka readings).


One solution for reducing energy consumption is to send sensors to sleep, however this will bring an accuracy problem since the middleware won't have data to work on and will try to infer values.


The key goal lies in discovering the best characteristics of the target complex spatial phenomenon being sensed, meeting the demands of the application, and satisfying the constraints on
sensor usage.


Context-aware middleware is defined as an abstract layer between the OS and running applications.
It aims to deal with the heterogeneity of the physical world through edge technologies, by adding more specialized mechanisms and services than an OS can provide.},

abstract = {Nowadays, as smartphones are becoming more and more powerful, applications providing location based services have been increasingly popular.Many, if not all, smartphones are equipped with a powerful sensor set (GPS,WiFi, the acceleration sensor, the orientation sensor, etc.), which makes them capable of accomplishing complicated tasks. Unfortunately, as the core enabler of most location tracking applications on smartphones, GPS incurs an unacceptable energy cost that can cause the complete battery drain within a few hours. Although GPS is often preferred over its alternatives, the coverage areas of GPS are still limited (GPS typically cannot function indoors). To this end, our goal in this paper is to improve the energy-efficiency of traditional location tracking service as well as to expand its coverage areas. In this paper, we introduce SensTrack, a location tracking service that leverages the sensor hints on the smartphone to reduce the usage of GPS. SensTrack selectively executes a GPS sampling using the information from the acceleration and orientation sensors and switches to the alternate location sensing method based on WiFi when users move indoors. A machine learning technique,Gaussian process regression, is then employed to reconstruct the trajectory from the recorded location samples. We implemented a prototype on an Android smartphone that can sample the related sensors during the user's movement and collect the sensor data for further processing on PCs. Evaluation on traces from real users demonstrates that SensTrack can significantly reduce the usage of GPS and still achieve a high tracking accuracy.},

Different from previous research that focused on the properties of single module under a limited number of usage scenarios, our works are performed on the statistically selected representative Apps with four generations of Samsung Galaxy series smartphones. We found that over the four characterized generations, the average power consumption of the smartphones with a connected Wi-Fi network on the selected Apps increases about 38.20{\%}, indicating more and more energy-hungry designs. However, the raising of the power consumption is not mainly from the radio modules as the power ef- ficiency of theWi-Fi module indeed improves by about 21{\%}. The 4G module consumes about 15.13{\%} more power compared to the latest 3G module. But the power efficiency of 3G module improves by averagely 15.17{\%} over the four generations. The GPS module also shows 25.80{\%} power consumption improvement over the generations. We also show that the characterized power results can be combined with the real user traces for detailed daily energy usage estimation. Our research established an ethological and evolution- ary power consumption trend of smartphones, which will guide the power optimization in the next-generation smartphone design.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel framework that includes an inhomogeneous (time-variant) Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and learning from data concepts. The framework either recognizes or estimates user contextual inferences called `user states' within the concept of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) for future context-aware applications. Context-aware applications require continuous data acquisition and interpretation from one or more sensor reading(s). Therefore, device battery lifetimes need to be extended due to the fact that constantly running built-in sensors deplete device batteries rapidly. In this sense, a framework is constructed to fulfill requirements needed by applications and to prolong device battery lifetimes. The ultimate goal of this paper is to present an accurate user state representation model, and to maximize power efficiency while the model operates. Most importantly, this research intends to create and clarify a generic framework to guide the development of future context-aware applications. Moreover, topics such as user profile adaptability and variant sensory sampling operations are examined. The proposed framework is validated by simulations and implemented in a HAR-based application by the smartphone accelerometer. According to the results, the proposed framework shows an increase in power efficiency of 60{\%} for an accuracy range from 75{\%} up to 96{\%}, depending on user profiles.},

abstract = {While evolving mobile technologies bring millions of users closer to the vision of information anywhere-anytime, device battery depletions still hamper the quality of experience to a great extent. The energy consumption of data transmission is highly dependent on the traffic pattern, and we argue that designing energy efficient data transmissions starts by energy awareness. Our work proposes EnergyBox, a parametrised tool that facilitates accurate and repeatable energy consumption studies for 3G and WiFi transmissions at the user end using real traffic data. The tool takes as input the parameters of a network operator and the power draw for a given mobile device in the 3G and WiFi transmission states. It outputs an estimate of the consumed energy for a given packet trace, either synthetic or captured in a device using real applications. Using nine different applications with different data patterns the versatility and accuracy of the tool was evaluated. The evaluation was carried out for a modern and popular smartphone in the WiFi setting, a specific mobile broadband module for the 3G setting, and within the operating environment of a major mobile operator in Sweden. A comparison with real power traces indicates that EnergyBox is a valuable tool for repeatable and convenient studies. It exhibits an accuracy of 94-99{\%} for 3G, and 95-99{\%} for WiFi given the studied applications' traces. Next the tool was deployed in a use case where a location sharing application was ran on top of two alternative application layer protocols (HTTP and MQTT) and with two different data exchange formats (JSON and Base64). The illustrative use case helped to identify the appropriateness of the pull and push strategies in sharing location data, and the benefit of EnergyBox in characterising where the breaking point lies for preferring one or the other protocol, under which network load, or exchange data format. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

In this paper, we move towards this direction and aim to geographically mine the similarity between users based on their location histories. Such user similarity is significant to individuals, communities and businesses by helping them effectively retrieve the information with high relevance. A framework, referred to as hierarchical- graph-based similarity measurement (HGSM), is proposed for geographic information systems to consistently model each individual's location history and effectively measure the similarity among users. In this framework, we take into account both the sequence property of people's movement behaviors and the hierarchy property of geographic spaces. We evaluate this framework using the GPS data collected by 65 volunteers over a period of 6 months in the real world. As a result, HGSM outperforms related similarity measures, such as the cosine similarity and Pearson similarity measures},

Moreover, continuous sensing affects the battery performance of the mobile device. This motivates a need for energy efficient sensor-data collection with a minimum number of mobile devices. This paper presents an algorithm that makes a trade-off between the energy consumption and the number of involved mobile devices in the sensing environment, subject to satisfying the sensing needs of multiple applications.

abstract = {We present VibN, a mobile sensing application deployed at large scale through the Apple App Store and the Android Market. VibN has been built to determine “what's going on” around the user in real-time by exploiting multiple sen- sor feeds. The application allows its users to explore live points of interest of the city by presenting real-time hotspots from sensor data. Each hotspot is characterized by a demo- graphics breakdown of inhabitants and a list of short audio clips. The audio clips augment traditional microblogging methods by allowing users to automatically and manually provide rich audio data about their locations. VibN also al- lows one to browse historical points of interest and viewhow locations in a city evolve over time. Additionally, VibN au- tomatically determines a user's personal points of interest, which are a means for building a user's breadcrumb diary of locations where they have spent significant amount of time. In this paper, we present the design, evaluation, and results from the large scale deployment ofVibN through the popular Apple App Store and Android Market.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce MobIoT, a service-oriented middleware that enables large-scale mobile participatory sensing. Scalability is achieved by limiting the participation of redundant sensing devices. Precisely, MobIoT allows a new device to register its services only if it increases the sensing coverage of a physical attribute, along its expected path, for the set of registered devices. We present the design and implementation of MobIoT, which mobile devices use to determine their registration decision and become accessible for their services. Through experiments performed on real datasets, we show that our solution scales, while meeting sensing coverage requirements. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We present the design, implementation and evaluation of the Jigsaw continuous sensing engine,which balances the per- formance needs of the application and the resource demands of continuous sensing on the phone. Jigsaw comprises a set of sensing pipelines for the accelerometer, microphone and GPS sensors, which are built in a plug and play manner to support: i) resilient accelerometer data processing,whichal- lows inferences to be robust to different phone hardware, ori- entation and body positions; ii) smart admission control and on-demand processing for the microphone and accelerome- ter data, which adaptively throttles the depth and sophistica- tion of sensing pipelineswhen the input data is lowquality or uninformative; and iii) adaptive pipeline processing, which judiciously triggers power hungry pipeline stages (e.g., sam- pling the GPS) taking into account the mobility and behav- ioral patterns of the user to drive down energy costs. We implement and evaluate Jigsaw on the Nokia N95 and the Apple iPhone, two popular smartphone platforms, to demon- strate its capability to recognize user activities and perform long term GPS tracking in an energy-efficientmanner},

abstract = {A noise map facilitates the monitoring of environmental noise pollution in urban areas. It can raise citizen awareness of noise pollution levels, and aid in the development of mitigation strategies to cope with the adverse effects. However, state-of-the-art techniques for rendering noise maps in urban areas are expensive and rarely updated (for months or even years), as they rely on population and traffic models rather than on real data. Smart phone based urban sensing can be leveraged to create an open and inexpensive platform for rendering up-to-date noise maps. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and performance evaluation of an end-to-end, context-aware, noise mapping system called Ear-Phone. Ear-Phone investigates the use of different interpolation and regularization methods to address the fundamental problem of recovering the noise map from incomplete and random samples obtained by crowdsourcing data collection. Ear-Phone, implemented on Nokia N95, N97 and HP iPAQ, HTC One mobile devices, also addresses the challenge of collecting accurate noise pollution readings at a mobile device. A major challenge of using smart phones as sensors is that even at the same location, the sensor reading may vary depending on the phone orientation and user context (for example, whether the user is carrying the phone in a bag or holding it in her hand). To address this problem, Ear-Phone leverages context-aware sensing. We develop classifiers to accurately determine the phone sensing context. Upon context discovery, Ear-Phone automatically decides whether to sense or not. Ear-Phone also implements in-situ calibration which performs simple calibration that can be carried out by general public. Extensive simulations and outdoor experiments demonstrate that Ear-Phone is a feasible platform to assess noise pollution, incurring reasonable system resource consumption at mobile devices and providing high reconstruction accuracy of the noise map. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Today's mobile phones are far from the mere communication devices they were 10 years ago. Equipped with sophisticated sensors and advanced computing hardware, phones can be used to infer users' location, activity, social setting, and more. As devices become increasingly intelligent, their capabilities evolve beyond inferring context to predicting it, and then reasoning and acting upon the predicted context. This article provides an overview of the current state of the art in mobile sensing and context prediction paving the way for full-fledged anticipatory mobile computing. We present a survey of phenomena that mobile phones can infer and predict, and offer a description of machine learning techniques used for such predictions. We then discuss proactive decision making and decision delivery via the user-device feedback loop. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of anticipatory mobile computing.},

abstract = {Neural signals are everywhere just like mobile phones. We propose to use neural signals to control mobile phones for hands-free, silent and effortless human-mobile interaction. Until recently, devices for detecting neural signals have been costly, bulky and fragile. We present the design, implemen- tation and evaluation of the NeuroPhone system, which al- lows neural signals to drive mobile phone applications on the iPhone using cheap off-the-shelf wireless electroencephalo- graphy (EEG) headsets. We demonstrate a brain-controlled address book dialing app, which works on similar princi- ples to P300-speller brain-computer interfaces: the phone flashes a sequence of photos of contacts from the address book and a P300 brain potential is elicited when the flashed photo matches the person whom the user wishes to dial. EEG signals from the headset are transmitted wirelessly to an iPhone, which natively runs a lightweight classifier to dis- criminate P300 signals from noise. When a persons contact- photo triggers a P300, his/her phone number is automati- cally dialed. NeuroPhone breaks new ground as a brain- mobile phone interface for ubiquitous pervasive computing. We discuss the challenges in making our initial prototype more practical, robust, and reliable as part of our on-going research.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incorporate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may be involved in such a system. In this paper, we focus specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite a broad category, are characterized by their specific application domain. Urban IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies to support added-value services for the administration of the city and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive survey of the enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture for an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the Padova Smart City project, a proof-of-concept deployment of an IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration with the city municipality.},

abstract = {This paper is inspired by how cognitive control manifests itself in the human brain and does so in a remarkable way. It addresses the many facets involved in the control of directed information flow in a dynamic system, culminating in the notion of information gap, defined as the difference between relevant information (useful part of what is extracted from the incoming measurements) and sufficient information representing the information needed for achieving minimal risk. The notion of information gap leads naturally to how cognitive control can itself be defined. Then, another important idea is described, namely the two-state model, in which one is the system's state and the other is the entropic state that provides an essential metric for quantifying the information gap. The entropic state is computed in the perceptual part (i.e., perceptor) of the dynamic system and sent to the controller directly as feedback information. This feedback information provides the cognitive controller the information needed about the environment and the system to bring reinforcement leaning into play; reinforcement learning (RL), incorporating planning as an integral part, is at the very heart of cognitive control. The stage is now set for a computational experiment, involving cognitive radar wherein the cognitive controller is enabled to control the receiver via the environment. The experiment demonstrates how RL provides the mechanism for improved utilization of computational resources, and yet is able to deliver good performance through the use of planning. The paper finishes with concluding remarks.},
