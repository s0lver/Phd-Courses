  Abstract                 = {The capacity to gather and timely deliver to the service level any relevant information that can characterize the service-provisioning environment, such as computing resources/capabilities, physical device location, user preferences, and time constraints, usually defined as context-awareness, is widely recognized as a core function for the development of modern ubiquitous and mobile systems. Much work has been done to enable context-awareness and to ease the diffusion of context-aware services; at the same time, several middleware solutions have been designed to transparently implement context management and provisioning in the mobile system. However, to the best of our knowledge, an in-depth analysis of the context data distribution, namely, the function in charge of distributing context data to interested entities, is still missing. Starting from the core assumption that only effective and efficient context data distribution can pave the way to the deployment of truly context-aware services, this article aims at putting together current research efforts to derive an original and holistic view of the existing literature. We present a unified architectural model and a new taxonomy for context data distribution by considering and comparing a large number of solutions. Finally, based on our analysis, we draw some of the research challenges still unsolved and identify some possible directions for future work.},

  Abstract                 = {Neural signals are everywhere just like mobile phones. We propose to use neural signals to control mobile phones for hands-free, silent and effortless human-mobile interaction. Until recently, devices for detecting neural signals have been costly, bulky and fragile. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of the NeuroPhone system, which allows neural signals to drive mobile phone applications on the iPhone using cheap off-the-shelf wireless electroencephalography (EEG) headsets. We demonstrate a brain-controlled address book dialing app, which works on similar principles to P300-speller brain-computer interfaces: the phone flashes a sequence of photos of contacts from the address book and a P300 brain potential is elicited when the flashed photo matches the person whom the user wishes to dial. EEG signals from the headset are transmitted wirelessly to an iPhone, which natively runs a lightweight classifier to discriminate P300 signals from noise. When a person's contact-photo triggers a P300, his/her phone number is automatically dialed. NeuroPhone breaks new ground as a brain-mobile phone interface for ubiquitous pervasive computing. We discuss the challenges in making our initial prototype more practical, robust, and reliable as part of our on-going research.},

Since it was proposed about a decade ago, many researchers have studied this topic and built several context-aware applications to demonstrate the usefulness of this new technology. Context-aware applications (or the system infrastructure to support them), however, have never been widely available to everyday users. In this survey of research on context-aware systems and applications, we looked in depth at the types of context used and models of context information, at systems that support collecting and disseminating context, and at applications that adapt to the changing context. Through this survey, it is clear that context-aware research is an old but rich area for research. The difficulties and possible solutions we outline serve as guidance for researchers hoping to make context-aware computing a reality.},

  Abstract                 = {Smartphones enable the collection of mobility data using various sensors. The key challenge in the collection of continuous data is to overcome the limited battery capacity of the device. While extensive research has been conducted to solve energy issues in continuous mobility learning, we argue that previous works have not reached optimal performance. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient mobility monitoring system, FreeTrack, to collect place-centric mobility data with minimum energy consumption in everyday life. We first analyzed the regularity of life patterns, cellular connection patterns, and battery charging behaviors of 94 smartphone users to examine important features related to human mobility. Based on our findings, we design an adaptive duty cycling scheme that uses zero-cost information (i.e., regular mobility, cell connection, and battery state) as low-level sensing to infer location change without the need to activate sensors. We model the location inference on the Hidden Markov Model and optimize the sensing schedule of individual smartphones for real-time operation. Our extensive experiment with 48 smartphone users shows that the proposed system achieves an energy saving of about 68% over previous works, yet still correctly traces 97% of mobility with 0.2Â±0.5 places misses in a day.},

  Abstract                 = {With the rapid development of new and innovative applications for mobile devices like smart phones, advances in battery technology have not kept pace with rapidly growing energy demands. Thus energy consumption has become a more and more important issue of mobile devices. To meet the requirements of saving energy, it is critical to monitor and analyze the energy consumption of applications on smart phones. For this purpose, we develop a smart energy monitoring system called SEMO for smart phones using Android operating system. It can profile mobile applications with battery usage information, which is vital for both developers and users.},

  Abstract                 = {Within the past decade, mobile computing has morphed into a principal form of human communication, business, and social interaction. Unfortunately, the energy demands of newer ambient intelligence and collaborative technologies on mobile devices have greatly overwhelmed modern energy storage abilities. This paper proposes several novel techniques that exploit spatiotemporal and device context to predict device wireless data and location interface configurations that can optimize energy consumption in mobile devices. These techniques, which include variants of linear discriminant analysis, linear logistic regression, non-linear logistic regression with neural networks, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machines are explored and compared on synthetic and user traces from real-world usage studies. The experimental results show that up to 90% successful prediction is possible with neural networks and k-nearest neighbor algorithms, improving upon prediction strategies in prior work by approximately 50%. Further, an average improvement of 24% energy savings is achieved compared to state-of-the-art prior work on energy-efficient location-sensing.},

In the automotive context, a variety of on-board and external sensors collect data as users drive.CarTel provides a simple query-oriented programming interface, handles large amounts of heterogeneous data from sensors, and handles intermittent and variable network connectivity. CarTel nodes rely primarily on opportunistic wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) connectivity to the Internet, or to "data mules" such as other CarTel nodes, mobile phone flash memories, or USB keys-to communicate with the portal. CarTel applications run on the portal, using a delay-tolerant continuous query processor, ICEDB, to specify how the mobile nodes should summarize, filter, and dynamically prioritize data. The portal and the mobile nodes use a delay-tolerant network stack, CafNet, to communicat.CarTel has been deployed on six cars, running on a small scale in Boston and Seattle for over a year. It has been used to analyze commute times, analyze metropolitan Wi-Fi deployments, and for automotive diagnostics.},

  Abstract                 = {An important feature of a modern mobile device is that it can position itself. Not only for use on the device but also for remote applications that require tracking of the device. To be useful, such position tracking has to be energy-efficient to avoid having a major impact on the battery life of the mobile device. Furthermore, tracking has to robustly deliver position updates when faced with changing conditions such as delays due to positioning and communication, and changing positioning accuracy.

This work proposes EnTracked - a system that, based on the estimation and prediction of system conditions and mobility, schedules position updates to both minimize energy consumption and optimize robustness. The realized system tracks pedestrian targets equipped with GPS-enabled devices. The system is configurable to realize different trade-offs between energy consumption and robustness.

We provide extensive experimental results by profiling how devices consume power, by emulation on collected data and by validation in several real-world deployments. Results from this profiling show how a device consumes power while tracking its position. Results from the emulation indicate that the system can estimate and predict system conditions and mobility. Furthermore they provide evidence for that the system can lower the energy consumption considerably and remain robust when faced with changing system conditions. By validation in several real-world deployments we provide evidence that the real system works as predicted by the emulation.},

Automated wellbeing tracking systems available so far have focused on physical fitness and sleep and often require external non-phone based sensors. In this work, we take a step towards a more comprehensive smartphone based system that can track activities that impact physical, social, and mental wellbeing namely, sleep, physical activity, and social interactions and provides intelligent feedback to promote better health. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of BeWell, an automated wellbeing app for the Android smartphones and demonstrate its feasibility in monitoring multi-dimensional wellbeing. By providing a more complete picture of health, BeWell has the potential to empower individuals to improve their overall wellbeing and identify any early signs of decline.},

  Abstract                 = {Many new wireless applications such as public safety and social networking have been emerging in recent years. Those applications introduce the necessity of direct communications among devices or peers without core network or wireless routers, which is not well supported in current network infrastructures. While some existing technologies can support certain levels of direct peer-to-peer communications, they are context-oblivious and inefficient. This article proposes a context-aware proximity-based P2P (CA-P2P) wireless communication system architecture to enable context awareness for direct P2P communications. The main idea is to systematically incorporate appropriate context information in direct communication protocols to improve overall performance. One of the major features is application-based communication, which connects peers according to their common applications. Accordingly, radio resources can be managed more efficiently among and within different application groups. Specifically, the scheme proposed in this article includes several new mechanisms such as context-aware peer discovery and context-aware peer association. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed context awareness system achieves fast and efficient peer discovery and peer association in terms of latency and overhead.},

Due to the severity of the issue, considerable researches have been devoted to energy-efficient locating sensing mechanism in the last few years.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract With the prevalence of localization techniques in smartphones, location-based applications on mobiles have become increasingly popular. However, only minorities of applications can be triggered automatically by the predefined locations of interest without any human interaction. One reason is that the inevitable operation of location detection by \{GPS\} is power-intensive. While existing work has focused on energy efficiency in continuous location tracking, energy-efficient location detection for matching predefined location of interest remains to be further explored. This paper proposes a unified framework that supports energy-efficient location detection for automatic location-triggered applications. Our framework triggers desired events only when the user is approaching the predefined locations of interest. Besides the efforts we make to reduce the number of \{GPS\} updates by cooperating with other types of on-device sensors, the framework also aims to coordinate multiple location-triggered applications to further reduce energy consumption on location updates. We implemented our framework as a middleware in the Android operating system and conducted extensive real experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework can reduce the number of \{GPS\} requests and low the energy consumption of the smartphones significantly.},

  Abstract                 = {Continuous sensing applications (e.g., mobile social networking applications) are appearing on new sensor-enabled mobile phones such as the Apple iPhone, Nokia and Android phones. These applications present significant challenges to the phone's operations given the phone's limited computational and energy resources and the need for applications to share real-time continuous sensed data with back-end servers. System designers have to deal with a trade-off between data accuracy (i.e., application fidelity) and energy constraints in the design of uploading strategies between phones and back-end servers. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of several techniques to optimize the information uploading process for continuous sensing on mobile phones. We analyze the cases of continuous and intermittent connectivity imposed by low-duty cycle design considerations or poor wireless network coverage in order to drive down energy consumption and extend the lifetime of the phone. We also show how location prediction can be integrated into this forecasting framework. We present the implementation and the experimental evaluation of these uploading techniques based on measurements from the deployment of a continuous sensing application on 20 Nokia N95 phones used by 20 people for a period of 2 weeks. Our results show that we can make significant energy savings while limiting the impact on the application fidelity, making continuous sensing a viable application for mobile phones. For example, we show that it is possible to achieve an accuracy of 80% with respect to ground-truth data while saving 60% of the traffic sent over-the-air.},

Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

G-Sense includes specific mechanisms to control the amount of data generated by these applications while meeting the application requirements.

  Abstract                 = {Nowadays mobile devices, represented mainly by smartphones, are used by million of people around the world. These smartphones include a large set of hardware capabilities and sensors which allow to improve the user interaction and content delivery. The sensors allow to gather extra information about the user situation and therefore to create location & context aware mobile apps. However, sensors usage involves energy consumption, which is also one of the smartphone's biggest limitations; in addition, these devices also have storage and memory constraints, and slow processors compared to a conventional computer. Recently, there is an emerging tendency consisting in lessen these limitations by implementing the complex computations and data storage in external entities such as cloud computing. This article presents the fundamentals for developing an energy-aware middleware for the support of context & location aware mobile apps with cloud computing interaction. This middleware can increase up to three times the smartphone battery performance when using the GPS receiver, and in the cloud can perform the extraction of places of interest from a list of GPS fixes uploaded by the smartphone.},

Currently, sampling and processing sensor data on the phone requires the main processor and associated components to be continuously on, creating a large energy overhead that can severely impact the battery lifetime of the phone. We will demonstrate Little Rock, a novel sensing architecture for mobile phones, where sampling and, when possible, processing of sensor data is offloaded to a dedicated low-power processor. This approach enables the phone to perform continuous sensing three orders of magnitude more energy efficiently compared to the normal approaches.},

In this paper, we experimentally and analytically investigate the design considerations that arise in the efficient use of the low power processor and provide a thorough understanding of the problem space. We answer fundamental questions such as which segments of the application are most efficient to be hosted on the low power processor, and how to select an appropriate low power processor.

  Abstract                 = {In the 1980s, we used power toolsets that consisted of five or six power tools but were delivered with a single motor attachable to each of the tools. The tools themselves were motorless. At the time, the rationale for this design was twofold: the motor was an expensive component and not replicating it saved money, and people did not need both their circular saw and their power drill at the same time. This approach has a long tradition and was also common, for example, with early electric kitchen appliances. Such systems have become uncommon. However, looking at current consumer electronics it seems that a similar trend might be emerging. This time the expensive and complex components are the user interface and the embedded processor. Hence, this component is shared among appliances.The variety of available devices, especially for the Android platform, is massive. Hence, many designs will likely include a mobile device whose size, processing power, and user interface capabilities can realize the requirements of the "computer." There are essentially two approaches to using mobile phones and MP3 players as computing components: in one, devices are sold as accessories to the phone; in the other, the phone becomes a part of the device. Examples for the first one can already be found in the market; for the second one, we have not seen examples yet.},

Then we give our architecture design proposal of the Internet of Things and then we design a specific the Internet of Things application model which can apply to automatic facilities management in the smart campus.

  Abstract                 = {Traffic delays and congestion are a major source of inefficiency, wasted fuel, and commuter frustration. Measuring and localizing these delays, and routing users around them, is an important step towards reducing the time people spend stuck in traffic. As others have noted, the proliferation of commodity smartphones that can provide location estimates using a variety of sensors---GPS, WiFi, and/or cellular triangulation---opens up the attractive possibility of using position samples from drivers' phones to monitor traffic delays at a fine spatiotemporal granularity. This paper presents VTrack, a system for travel time estimation using this sensor data that addresses two key challenges: energy consumption and sensor unreliability. While GPS provides highly accurate location estimates, it has several limitations: some phones don't have GPS at all, the GPS sensor doesn't work in "urban canyons" (tall buildings and tunnels) or when the phone is inside a pocket, and the GPS on many phones is power-hungry and drains the battery quickly. In these cases, VTrack can use alternative, less energy-hungry but noisier sensors like WiFi to estimate both a user's trajectory and travel time along the route. VTrack uses a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based map matching scheme and travel time estimation method that interpolates sparse data to identify the most probable road segments driven by the user and to attribute travel times to those segments. We present experimental results from real drive data and WiFi access point sightings gathered from a deployment on several cars. We show that VTrack can tolerate significant noise and outages in these location estimates, and still successfully identify delay-prone segments, and provide accurate enough delays for delay-aware routing algorithms. We also study the best sampling strategies for WiFi and GPS sensors for different energy cost regimes.},

The success of social networks to share experience and personalised insights shows also great potential for integration with business-centric applications.

Information sharing may be rewarded through incentives, thus transforming the Internet of Things from a cost-focused experiment to a revenue-generating infrastructure to enable trading of enriched information and accelerate business innovation. Mash-ups and end-user programming will enable people to contribute to the Internet of Things with data, presentation and functionality. Things-generated physical world content and events from Auto-ID, sensors, actuators or meshed networks will be aggregated and combined with information from virtual worlds, such as business databases and Web 2.0 applications, and processed based on new business intelligence concepts. Direct action on the physical world will be supported through machine-interfaces and introduction of agile strategies. This chapter aims to provide a concept for a future architecture of the Internet of Things, including a definition, a review of developments, a list of key requirements and a technical design for possible implementation of the future Internet of Things. As open issues, the evaluation of usability by stakeholders in user-centric as well as business-centric scenarios is discussed and the need for quantifying costs and benefits for businesses, consumers, society and the environment is emphasised. Finally, guidelines are derived, for use by researchers as well as practitioners.},

  Abstract                 = {Managing energy efficiently is paramount in modern smartphones. The diverse range of wireless interfaces and sensors, and the increasing popularity of power-hungry applications that take advantage of these resources can reduce the battery life of mobile handhelds to few hours of operation. The research community, and operating system and hardware vendors found interesting optimisations and techniques to extend the battery life of mobile phones. However, the state of the art of lithium-ion batteries clearly indicates that energy efficiency must be achieved both at the hardware and software level. In this survey, we will cover the software solutions that can be found in the research literature between 1999 and May 2011 at six different levels: energy-aware operating systems, efficient resource management, the impact of users' interaction patterns with mobile devices and applications, wireless interfaces and sensors management, and finally the benefits of integrating mobile devices with cloud computing services.},

First, this recommender provides taxi drivers with some locations and the routes to these locations, towards which they are more likely to pick up passengers quickly (during the routes or at these locations) and maximize the profit. Second, it recommends people with some locations (within a walking distance) where they can easily find vacant taxis. In our method, we learn the above knowledge (represented by probabilities) from GPS trajectories of taxis. Then, we feed the knowledge into a probabilistic model which estimates the profit of the candidate locations for a particular driver based on where and when the driver requests for the recommendation. We validate our recommender using historical trajectories generated by over 12,000 taxis during 110 days.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a novel framework that includes an inhomogeneous (time-variant) Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and learning from data concepts. The framework either recognizes or estimates user contextual inferences called `user states' within the concept of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) for future context-aware applications. Context-aware applications require continuous data acquisition and interpretation from one or more sensor reading(s). Therefore, device battery lifetimes need to be extended due to the fact that constantly running built-in sensors deplete device batteries rapidly. In this sense, a framework is constructed to fulfill requirements needed by applications and to prolong device battery lifetimes. The ultimate goal of this paper is to present an accurate user state representation model, and to maximize power efficiency while the model operates. Most importantly, this research intends to create and clarify a generic framework to guide the development of future context-aware applications. Moreover, topics such as user profile adaptability and variant sensory sampling operations are examined. The proposed framework is validated by simulations and implemented in a HAR-based application by the smartphone accelerometer. According to the results, the proposed framework shows an increase in power efficiency of 60% for an accuracy range from 75% up to 96%, depending on user profiles.},

  Abstract                 = {The ever increasing technological advances in embedded systems engineering, together with the proliferation of small-size sensor designs and deployment, have enabled smart devices to recognize daily human-based actions, activities, and interactions. Therefore, inferring a vast variety of user-device-based activities from diverse contexts obtained by a series of sensory observations has drawn much interest to the research area of ubiquitous sensing. The existence and awareness of context provides the capability of being conscious of physical environments or situations around users, and this allows network services to respond proactively and intelligently based on such awareness. Hence, with the evolution of smartphones, software developers have been empowered to create context-aware applications for recognizing human-centric or community based innovative social and cognitive activities in any situation and at any location. However, the middleware services provided in mobile devices have limited resources in terms of power, memory, and bandwidth compared to the capabilities of PCs and servers. Also, power is a major restriction on implementation of context-aware applications. Mobile device batteries do not last a long time while operating sensor(s) constantly. To this end, this article extensively surveys the emerging concepts of context awareness in mobile platforms by providing up-to-date literature and future research directives. We also point out the challenges faced in this regard and enlighten them by offering possible solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {Nowadays, as smartphones are becoming more and more powerful, applications providing location based services have been increasingly popular. Many, if not all, smartphones are equipped with a powerful sensor set (GPS, WiFi, the acceleration sensor, the orientation sensor, etc.), which makes them capable of accomplishing complicated tasks. Unfortunately, as the core enabler of most location tracking applications on smartphones, GPS incurs an unacceptable energy cost that can cause the complete battery drain within a few hours. Although GPS is often preferred over its alternatives, the coverage areas of GPS are still limited (GPS typically cannot function indoors). To this end, our goal in this paper is to improve the energy-efficiency of traditional location tracking service as well as to expand its coverage areas. In this paper, we introduce SensTrack, a location tracking service that leverages the sensor hints on the smartphone to reduce the usage of GPS. SensTrack selectively executes a GPS sampling using the information from the acceleration and orientation sensors and switches to the alternate location sensing method based on WiFi when users move indoors. A machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, is then employed to reconstruct the trajectory from the recorded location samples. We implemented a prototype on an Android smartphone that can sample the related sensors during the user's movement and collect the sensor data for further processing on PCs. Evaluation on traces from real users demonstrates that SensTrack can significantly reduce the usage of GPS and still achieve a high tracking accuracy.},
