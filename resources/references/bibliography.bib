  volume = {44},

  abstract = {The capacity to gather and timely deliver to the service level any
	relevant information that can characterize the service-provisioning
	environment, such as computing resources/capabilities, physical device
	location, user preferences, and time constraints, usually defined
	as context-awareness, is widely recognized as a core function for
	the development of modern ubiquitous and mobile systems. Much work
	has been done to enable context-awareness and to ease the diffusion
	of context-aware services; at the same time, several middleware solutions
	have been designed to transparently implement context management
	and provisioning in the mobile system. However, to the best of our
	knowledge, an in-depth analysis of the context data distribution,
	namely, the function in charge of distributing context data to interested
	entities, is still missing. Starting from the core assumption that
	only effective and efficient context data distribution can pave the
	way to the deployment of truly context-aware services, this article
	aims at putting together current research efforts to derive an original
	and holistic view of the existing literature. We present a unified
	architectural model and a new taxonomy for context data distribution
	by considering and comparing a large number of solutions. Finally,
	based on our analysis, we draw some of the research challenges still
	unsolved and identify some possible directions for future work.},

	interfaces: the phone flashes a sequence of photos of contacts from
	the address book and a P300 brain potential is elicited when the
	flashed photo matches the person whom the user wishes to dial. EEG
	signals from the headset are transmitted wirelessly to an iPhone,
	which natively runs a lightweight classifier to discriminate P300
	signals from noise. When a person's contact-photo triggers a P300,
	his/her phone number is automatically dialed. NeuroPhone breaks new

	itself. Not only for use on the device but also for remote applications
	that require tracking of the device. To be useful, such position
	tracking has to be energy-efficient to avoid having a major impact
	on the battery life of the mobile device. Furthermore, tracking has
	to robustly deliver position updates when faced with changing conditions
	such as delays due to positioning and communication, and changing
	positioning accuracy.
	
	
	This work proposes EnTracked - a system that, based on the estimation
	and prediction of system conditions and mobility, schedules position
	updates to both minimize energy consumption and optimize robustness.
	The realized system tracks pedestrian targets equipped with GPS-enabled
	devices. The system is configurable to realize different trade-offs
	between energy consumption and robustness.
	
	
	We provide extensive experimental results by profiling how devices
	consume power, by emulation on collected data and by validation in
	several real-world deployments. Results from this profiling show
	how a device consumes power while tracking its position. Results
	from the emulation indicate that the system can estimate and predict
	system conditions and mobility. Furthermore they provide evidence
	for that the system can lower the energy consumption considerably
	and remain robust when faced with changing system conditions. By
	validation in several real-world deployments we provide evidence
	that the real system works as predicted by the emulation.},

	the necessity of direct communications among devices or peers without
	core network or wireless routers, which is not well supported in
	current network infrastructures. While some existing technologies
	can support certain levels of direct peer-to-peer communications,
	they are context-oblivious and inefficient. This article proposes
	a context-aware proximity-based P2P (CA-P2P) wireless communication
	system architecture to enable context awareness for direct P2P communications.
	The main idea is to systematically incorporate appropriate context
	information in direct communication protocols to improve overall
	performance. One of the major features is application-based communication,
	which connects peers according to their common applications. Accordingly,
	radio resources can be managed more efficiently among and within
	different application groups. Specifically, the scheme proposed in
	this article includes several new mechanisms such as context-aware
	peer discovery and context-aware peer association. Simulation results
	demonstrate that the proposed context awareness system achieves fast
	and efficient peer discovery and peer association in terms of latency

	are appearing on new sensor-enabled mobile phones such as the Apple
	iPhone, Nokia and Android phones. These applications present significant
	challenges to the phone's operations given the phone's limited computational
	and energy resources and the need for applications to share real-time
	continuous sensed data with back-end servers. System designers have
	to deal with a trade-off between data accuracy (i.e., application
	fidelity) and energy constraints in the design of uploading strategies
	between phones and back-end servers. In this paper, we present the
	design, implementation and evaluation of several techniques to optimize
	the information uploading process for continuous sensing on mobile
	phones. We analyze the cases of continuous and intermittent connectivity
	imposed by low-duty cycle design considerations or poor wireless
	network coverage in order to drive down energy consumption and extend
	the lifetime of the phone. We also show how location prediction can
	be integrated into this forecasting framework. We present the implementation
	and the experimental evaluation of these uploading techniques based
	on measurements from the deployment of a continuous sensing application
	on 20 Nokia N95 phones used by 20 people for a period of 2 weeks.
	Our results show that we can make significant energy savings while
	limiting the impact on the application fidelity, making continuous
	sensing a viable application for mobile phones. For example, we show
	that it is possible to achieve an accuracy of 80% with respect to
	ground-truth data while saving 60% of the traffic sent over-the-air.},

	This approach has a long tradition and was also common, for example,
	with early electric kitchen appliances. Such systems have become

	that a similar trend might be emerging. This time the expensive and

	Hence, this component is shared among appliances.The variety of available
	devices, especially for the Android platform, is massive. Hence,
	many designs will likely include a mobile device whose size, processing

  abstract = {Nowadays, the main communication form on the Internet is human-human.
	But it is foreseeable that in a near soon that any object will have
	a unique way of identification and can be addressed so that every
	object can be connected. The Internet will become to the Internet
	of Things. The communicate forms will expand from human-human to
	human-human, human-thing and thing-thing (also called M2M).This will
	bring a new ubiquitous computing and communication era and change
	people's life extremely. Radio Frequency Identification techniques
	(RFID) and related identification technologies will be the cornerstones
	of the upcoming Internet of Things (IOT).This paper aims to show
	a skeleton of the Internet of Things and we try to address some essential
	issues of the Internet of Things like its architecture and the interoperability,
	etc. At the beginning we describe an overview of the Internet of
	Things. Then we give our architecture design proposal of the Internet
	of Things and then we design a specific the Internet of Things application
	model which can apply to automatic facilities management in the smart
	campus. At last, we discuss some open questions about the Internet
	of Things.},

  abstract = {Traffic delays and congestion are a major source of inefficiency,
	wasted fuel, and commuter frustration. Measuring and localizing these
	delays, and routing users around them, is an important step towards
	reducing the time people spend stuck in traffic. As others have noted,
	the proliferation of commodity smartphones that can provide location
	estimates using a variety of sensors---GPS, WiFi, and/or cellular
	triangulation---opens up the attractive possibility of using position
	samples from drivers' phones to monitor traffic delays at a fine
	spatiotemporal granularity. This paper presents VTrack, a system
	for travel time estimation using this sensor data that addresses
	two key challenges: energy consumption and sensor unreliability.
	While GPS provides highly accurate location estimates, it has several
	limitations: some phones don't have GPS at all, the GPS sensor doesn't
	work in "urban canyons" (tall buildings and tunnels) or when the
	phone is inside a pocket, and the GPS on many phones is power-hungry
	and drains the battery quickly. In these cases, VTrack can use alternative,
	less energy-hungry but noisier sensors like WiFi to estimate both
	a user's trajectory and travel time along the route. VTrack uses
	a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based map matching scheme and travel
	time estimation method that interpolates sparse data to identify
	the most probable road segments driven by the user and to attribute
	travel times to those segments. We present experimental results from
	real drive data and WiFi access point sightings gathered from a deployment
	on several cars. We show that VTrack can tolerate significant noise
	and outages in these location estimates, and still successfully identify
	delay-prone segments, and provide accurate enough delays for delay-aware
	routing algorithms. We also study the best sampling strategies for
	WiFi and GPS sensors for different energy cost regimes.},

  abstract = {Many of the initial developments towards the Internet of Things have
	focused on the combination of Auto-ID and networked infrastructures
	in business-to-business logistics and product life cycle applications.
	However, a future Internet of Things can provide a broader vision
	and also enable everyone to access and contribute rich information
	about things and locations. The success of social networks to share
	experience and personalised insights shows also great potential for
	integration with business-centric applications. The integration and
	interoperability with mainstream business software platforms can
	be enhanced and extended by real-time analytics, business intelligence
	and agent-based autonomous services. Information sharing may be rewarded
	through incentives, thus transforming the Internet of Things from
	a cost-focused experiment to a revenue-generating infrastructure
	to enable trading of enriched information and accelerate business
	innovation. Mash-ups and end-user programming will enable people
	to contribute to the Internet of Things with data, presentation and
	functionality. Things-generated physical world content and events
	from Auto-ID, sensors, actuators or meshed networks will be aggregated
	and combined with information from virtual worlds, such as business
	databases and Web 2.0 applications, and processed based on new business
	intelligence concepts. Direct action on the physical world will be
	supported through machine-interfaces and introduction of agile strategies.
	This chapter aims to provide a concept for a future architecture
	of the Internet of Things, including a definition, a review of developments,
	a list of key requirements and a technical design for possible implementation
	of the future Internet of Things. As open issues, the evaluation
	of usability by stakeholders in user-centric as well as business-centric
	scenarios is discussed and the need for quantifying costs and benefits
	for businesses, consumers, society and the environment is emphasised.
	Finally, guidelines are derived, for use by researchers as well as
	practitioners.},

  abstract = {The ever increasing technological advances in embedded systems engineering,
	together with the proliferation of small-size sensor designs and
	deployment, have enabled smart devices to recognize daily human-based
	actions, activities, and interactions. Therefore, inferring a vast
	variety of user-device-based activities from diverse contexts obtained
	by a series of sensory observations has drawn much interest to the
	research area of ubiquitous sensing. The existence and awareness
	of context provides the capability of being conscious of physical
	environments or situations around users, and this allows network
	services to respond proactively and intelligently based on such awareness.
	Hence, with the evolution of smartphones, software developers have
	been empowered to create context-aware applications for recognizing
	human-centric or community based innovative social and cognitive
	activities in any situation and at any location. However, the middleware
	services provided in mobile devices have limited resources in terms
	of power, memory, and bandwidth compared to the capabilities of PCs
	and servers. Also, power is a major restriction on implementation
	of context-aware applications. Mobile device batteries do not last
	a long time while operating sensor(s) constantly. To this end, this
	article extensively surveys the emerging concepts of context awareness
	in mobile platforms by providing up-to-date literature and future
	research directives. We also point out the challenges faced in this
