\section{Conclusions}
Mobile devices, like the smartphones, have become sophisticated computing elements that have the capability of sensing the environment. 
Numerous examples of mobile apps leveraging the sensing and computing features of the smartphones can be found in the market, being known as mobile sensing apps.

The mobile sensing apps expand the benefits that smartphones can offer, but also have a great impact in the energy consumption of the devices.
The energy consumption represent a complex and cross layer issue that has been tried to solve from several perspectives.
This technical report has presented a brief description of this problem, a revision of the basic elements for its comprehension and a taxonomy of the works aiming to solve this issue.

Finally, the revision of a pure software solution for this problem is also described.
This solution aims to increase the smartness level of the mobile platform, becoming aware of the environment for making informed decisions about the sensors usage.
