\abstract{
The popularity of modern smartphones and mobile sensing apps is a consequence of the mobility and increasing storage, computing and communication features of these devices. 
Because of this, the smartphone has become a full time companion of user. 
Nevertheless, the energy consumption in mobile sensing apps represents an open problem in the research that has been addressed from several perspectives since its relevance through all layers of the mobile platform.

This technical report describes the initial stage of a work thesis focused in solving the energy issue from a software perspective.
It refers to the advances developed during the first period of the doctoral program and includes a description of the problem and a review of the state of art which presents a taxonomy of works addressing this problem.
Additionally, a review of the method pursued in this research for solving the problem is also presented.
