\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future_work}
At this moment, a first revision of the state of art has been done.
However, further work is needed to strength the proposed taxonomy and to enrich this revision of the literature.

It is important to mention that during this period the Embedded Systems subject has been coursed following the suggestions of the committee during the thesis proposal defense. Also, for the next period there is the suggestion to take a subject regarding pattern recognition and data analysis techniques which is expected to be helpful to get basic knowledge about the area and to start classifying data. Such data is planned to be captured by developing an Android mobile app with the objective of employing real data and prepare datasets before the experimentation phase arrives.

Finally, work for defining and selecting the mobility patterns to be identified in the method will also be done in the next period.
