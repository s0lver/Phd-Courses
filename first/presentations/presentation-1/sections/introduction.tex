\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{block}{Mobile devices (MD) adoption by society}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item MD are used massively around the world \citep{Qureshi2014}  thanks to their Internet-enabled features, increasing storage and computing capabilities, and embedded sensors.
      \item Sensors allow mobile devices to become \emph{omni-sensors} of the environment.
      \item By analyzing data from environment, smart devices become \emph{context aware}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{block}{Contextual information from smartphones}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Context refers to the set of environmental states and settings that either determines an applicationâ€™s behavior or in which an application event occurs and is interesting to the user \citep{Chen2000}.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Context aware mobile apps.
        \item Location aware mobile apps, also known as Location Based Services.
      \end{itemize}
      
      \item Considering their functional operation, these apps are known as \textbf{mobile sensing apps (MSA)} \citep{Lane2010,Campbell2012}.
      \item MSA core activities are:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Sensing data from environment.
         \item Analyzing these data.
         \item Generating high level information with a special meaning to the final user.
       \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Convergence of MSA into the Internet of Things}
%   \begin{block}{The fully connected world idea}
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item MSA are contributing to the adoption of smart devices by society, creating a fully connected world of people.
%       \item The idea has been also pursued in scenarios like industry, where the items to be connected are real world objects like tools, machines, etc.
%       \item The items are enhanced with identification mechanisms and storage, computing and communication facilities, becoming \emph{smart objects}.
%       \item The interaction of smart objects creates a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication system.
%     \end{itemize}
%   \end{block}
% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Convergence of MSA into the Internet of Things}
%   \begin{block}{The emergence of The Internet of Things}
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item M2M communication systems aim to be the base mechanism to interconnect any smart objects of the real world.
%       \item MSA and M2M communication systems are pursuing a globally connected world of people and smart objects.
%       \item They can be abstracted as systems that interconnect \emph{things} in an evolved version of Internet called the \emph{Internet of Things (IoT)}.
%       \item IoT aims to produce a fully connected world with application systems that address any real world problem.
%     \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{block}{Motivation}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Advances in battery research are not at the same pace than those related to other components of MD \citep{Kjaergaard2012}.
      \item The battery is a limited source of energy that is impacted by sensors and other embedded electronics usage.
      \item It is mandatory for any mobile application development to consider the energy constraint and implement mechanisms to optimize battery duration.
    \end{itemize}

% \begin{frame}{Introduction}
%   \begin{block}{Motivation}
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item Therefore, despite the benefits of MSA the issue of energy reduces the time and diversity of tasks a smart device can be used for.
%       \item This issue becomes critical when performing continuous sensor access.
%       \item It is mandatory for any mobile application development to consider the energy constraint and implement mechanisms to optimize battery duration.
