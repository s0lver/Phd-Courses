    \begin{itemize}
      \item A mechanism for detecting patterns (contextual information) from the data read by sensors of mobile devices (specifically the GPS receiver).
      \item A mechanism for generating policies for accessing sensors that considers mobile app requirements and information about user's context.
      \item A software element able to read data from sensors using the policies generated by the described mechanisms and transmit these data to an external server.
