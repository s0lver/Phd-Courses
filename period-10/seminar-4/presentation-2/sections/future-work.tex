\begin{block}{\small \textbf{Conclusions}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The experiments demonstrate the system's ability to identify the coarse-grain mobility events for building the STM: %. A first approximation shows that:% The first problem
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Centroid distance between ground truth and observed stay points is at most $22.5 m$.
  	\item All stay points are detected, the arrival and departure latencies are within the active sampling rate.
  	\item The length of the visits missed by the \emph{Geofencing} are short, no longer than 4 minutes.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item The STM information has proved its usefulness for the CC to reduce energy consumption with a minor impact on spatial-time accuracy: % The second problem

  \begin{itemize}
  	\item The latencies and spatial differences at arrival and departure events are within the expected values.
  	\item Only 33 â€“ 49 \% of the location updates of a fixed $30 s$ sampling rate are employed in simulations.
  	\item On-device trials show a battery life increase of $26 - 76 h$, with respect of a fixed $30 s$ sampling rate.
  \end{itemize}

  \item The hypothesis is demonstrated as shown by the implementation of the CDS and the associated experimentation. %These results provide a solid evidence for demonstrating that the hypothesis implemented through the proposed CDS fulfills the objectives and contributions pursued by this research work.
  \item The EDS approach eases the design and implementation of the system, as it suits the characteristics of mobile platforms. % Nevertheless, experimentation is needed to assess its energy performance.
  \item The developed middleware isolates sensors and power management complexity for long-term LBSs and MBSs.
  % \item The future work is mostly focused on final refinements of the solution and conducting experiments with a larger and heterogeneous mobility, as well as on its comparison against related solutions.
  \item Advances on the research work have been submitted for publication (three journal articles \cite{Perez-Torres2016,Perez-Torres2016b,Perez-Torres2018}).
