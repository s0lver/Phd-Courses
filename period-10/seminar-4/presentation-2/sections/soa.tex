\begin{block}{\small \textbf{Remarks}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The exploitation of coarse and fine-grain mobility information for modeling and characterizing user mobility has been barely explored.
  \item Although some of the proposed solutions employ a duty cycling strategy, it is fixed and obeys to instant mobility information, neglecting the temporal evolution of user mobility.
  \item A spatial-time accurate and energy efficient adaptive sampling could be produced by a cognitive approach that understands long-term mobility from fine and coarse-grain mobility events.
  \item The cognitive approach goes beyond typical pattern recognition and classic control strategies that follow a static configuration, as it evolves (in the learning and action tasks) across time.
  \item The smartphone itself could augment not only its location but also its mobility awareness (per-user basis).
