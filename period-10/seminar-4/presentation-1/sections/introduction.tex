\begin{block}{\small \textbf{Background}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Smart devices, such as the smartphone, become popular after the advances on its underlying technologies.
	\item The sensing dimension enables \emph{context-awareness} in mobile device, for improved human -- computer interaction and enhanced information.
	\item Battery advances are slower than those of other smartphone components~\cite{Kjaergaard2012}, growing 5-10\% yearly~\cite{Ma2012,Evarts2015}.
	\item The energy constraint is critical when continuous access to sensors is needed, as in \textbf{mobile sensing applications}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{\small \textbf{Motivation}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item For the sensing dimension, scientific efforts have been done for achieving the energy efficiency of the GPS location provider.
	\item The understanding of mobility could augment the location-awareness of the smartphone for many purposes, such as energy savings and the development of Location and Mobility Based Services (LBS, MBS).
	\item Mobility Based Services are of paramount importance for future Internet of Things (IoT) developments, such as smart cities \cite{Zanella2014}.
	\item As a high level of abstraction, mobility can be characterized as a sequence of frequently visited places (stay points) using different transportation modes.
