\small
\begin{itemize}
  \item The understanding of mobility is possible at different spatial-temporal scales:
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{\small \textbf{Fine-grain mobility patterns identification}}
 \begin{itemize}
    \item They refer to the transportation mode employed by user when moving between stay points.
    \item Given a set of values $\mathcal{V} = \left \{ v_{acc~1},v_{acc~2},\ldots,v_{acc~n} \right \}$ obtained from accelerometer in the time interval $[t_1,t_2]$, identify fine-grain mobility information:
\begin{equation*}
  \text{\textbf{FineGrainMobilityIdentifier}}(\mathcal{V}) \rightarrow p_S \in \{ \text{static, walking, biking, vehicle} \}
\end{equation*}
with each $v_{acc~i} \in \mathcal{V}$ composed as $\langle acc_x,acc_y,acc_z,t \rangle$.
  \end{itemize} 
\end{exampleblock}

\begin{exampleblock}{\small \textbf{Coarse-grain mobility patterns identification}}
 \begin{itemize}
   \item They refer to motion at a large spatial scale related to user visiting stay points.
   \item \sloppy Given a set of values $\mathcal{V} = \left \{ v_{gps~1},v_{gps~2},\ldots,v_{gps~n} \right \}$ obtained from GPS location provider in time interval $[t_1,t_2]$, identify coarse-grain mobility information:
\begin{equation*}
    \text{\textbf{CoarseGrainMobilityIdentifier}}(\mathcal{V}) \rightarrow p_S \in \{ \text{new stay point, arrival, departure} \}
\end{equation*}
with each $v_{gps~i} \in \mathcal{V}$ composed associated $\langle lat, lon, t \rangle$.

\begin{frame}{Hypothesis}

\begin{block}{\small \textbf{Hypothesis}}
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.4}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The energy consumption of continuous and extended location tracking could be reduced by means of a cognitive dynamic system that learns an expanded spatial-time model from mobility events detected from sensors data and that employs such model in a cognitive controller for dynamically adapting GPS sampling rate through sampling policies tailored to current mobility state.
